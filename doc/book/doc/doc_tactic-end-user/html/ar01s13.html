(container) during checkin, TACTIC uses "versions" and "contexts."
Snapshot data always includes this information.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Contexts</strong></span> define a separate "channel" for checking in files. For
example, one SObject may require separate files to be checked in for
different tasks. For example, in the following list one drawing file is
checked into a single SObject with both "rough" and "final" contexts
(and with multiple versions). In this case, the contexts represent files
checked in for both the <span class="emphasis"><em>rough</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>final</em></span> processes (tasks).</p><pre class="screen">/assets/myProject/drawings/drawing_001/drawing_001_rough_v001.png

descriptive containers that store all the information necessary to
define an object and track it. If the definition of the Search Type
permits, an SObject can contain relationships to child SObjects.
Separate SObject children can be used to store extra data. For example,
they could be "task" SObjects set up based on the pipeline to track
approvals and notes, or they could be "snapshot" SObjects that store
file checkin and location information.</p><p>In a project, an SObject can be used to store the production data for
any digital asset requiring multiple associated files. When you create a
new SObject, you must create it based on a Search Type (for example, the
"model" Search Type). When you insert this new SObject, you are simply
inserting a new entry into the "model" Search Type’s library. Based on
the associated template Search Type, the new SObject will require
specific data to be inserted. For example, a name, description, pipeline
code and so on.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_retire"></a>13.3. Retire</h3></div></div></div><p>At times you may wish to offline an Search Object but, not remove it
from the system. Every search type has a s_status preperty that when set
to <span class="emphasis"><em>retired</em></span> hides the SObject but, makes is easy to reactivate it.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_sidebar_2"></a>13.4. Sidebar</h3></div></div></div><p>Views provide users with what they need to see and how they need to see
it. The are collections of different Search Type properties which are
relevant to a team members role in Tactic. Views are mainly accessed
through links in the sidebar either as <span class="strong"><strong>Project Views</strong></span> which are
configured for the whole production (but ca be controlled with access
rules) and <span class="strong"><strong>My Views</strong></span> which are views a uses saves as their own personal
views or "bookmarks". Views can also contain a saved search which,
provides a view as a live report.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_project_workflow"></a>13.5. Project Workflow</h3></div></div></div><p>Pipelines define a hierarchical set of processes that lay out all of the
production and approval steps an SObject must go through before being
completed. It is important to note that each process contains its own
set of approvals (task pipeline). Typically a process must be completed
before it can be handed off to the downstream process or processes.
TACTIC uses pipelines in this manner: when a process is approved, the
next downstream processes receive the green light to start.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_file_system"></a>13.6. File System</h3></div></div></div><p>When files are checked in to TACTIC, they are passed through the
directory and file naming conventions. This relieves the user of the
responsibility of figuring out where to place files on the server and
what to name them. Naming conventions are defined using the "naming"
Search Type, which stores an expression used by TACTIC to generate the
location and name for a file upon checkin.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_query"></a>13.7. Query</h3></div></div></div><p>A query into TACTIC is a request to retrieve Search Objects from the
database. In the Tactic interface when a user searches for something,
they are doing a query.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_view"></a>13.8. View</h3></div></div></div><p>Views in the TACTIC interface are built using a "Table" widget that is
defined based on a Search Type. Views can be configured to display
specific properties (columns) and also the widgets (tools) that are used
to display them.</p><p>Views can also be filtered to control which SObjects are displayed with
search tools. For example, search tools can create reports, or views
summarizing which SObjects are at which stages in the pipeline. Views
and reports can be saved as either project views, visible to multiple
team members, or as personal views, visible to individuals ("My Views").</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_note"></a>13.9. Note</h3></div></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_event"></a>13.10. Event</h3></div></div></div><p>The TACTIC system is based on events, and every interaction with any
SObject is tracked. Events may include changing a status, adding a note
or checking in a file (to list but a few examples). Every event is
logged into a transaction log, and can be undone. The transaction log is
very valuable because it enables easy tracking of when something
happened and who did it.</p><p>An event can also execute another event in the system (or a "trigger").
Triggers are set up as custom scripts which can be configured to do
almost anything in TACTIC through the TACTIC Client API. Example uses of
triggers include changing the status of another task SObject, checking
in additional files, or executing an external rendering application.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_access_rule"></a>13.11. Access Rule</h3></div></div></div><p>When configuring TACTIC, it is important for both security and
simplicity to set up appropriate access rules. Access Rules are
typically applied to user groups, making it easier to control what
different groups of users or departments can access in TACTIC.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_project"></a>13.12. Project</h3></div></div></div><p>A TACTIC project defines a real-world project or separates one of its
timelines. Each TACTIC project has its own separate database and
structure. Projects are the highest level separation in TACTIC. They
represent a separation in workflow, Searchable Types, Views, Access
Rules, Naming Conventions Pipelines and more</p><p>Custom TACTIC projects can be built from the ground up to manage
specific types of objects, processes and files. Alternatively,
predefined, ready-to-use TACTIC project modules are available to
expedite the setup process and provide custom integration tools
appropriate for the project type.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_update"></a>13.13. Update</h3></div></div></div><p>When you update an existing Serch Object in Tactic, this is called an
update. For example if you change the description property (column
entry), saving the cnages commits an update to the database.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_snapshot"></a>13.14. Snapshot</h3></div></div></div><p>A snapshot describes an asset at a particular point in time. This
description is sufficient to reproduce the asset completely at that
point in time. TACTIC has its own XML description language to completely
define assets and their dependencies to other assets.</p><p>A snapshot can contain any number of files. For example, in a Flash
production, a typical checkin will result in 4 files: a .fla (the flash
file to work on), .swf (a viewable file), and 2 pngs which represent a
small icon and a large viewable image.</p><p>Every time something is checked in, a new snapshot is created of the
asset. Snapshots can reference other snapshots, which allows TACTIC to
define dependencies to other assets or other snapshots of the same
asset.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_searchable_type_stype"></a>13.15. Searchable Type (sType)</h3></div></div></div><p>Within a project, there are many types of objects to manage, and each
object type requires different properties and types of files to be
stored. TACTIC uses <span class="strong"><strong>Search Types</strong></span> to categorize the many types of
objects that can exist in a project. Search Types are templates that
determine how these objects are defined and handled. Views, pipelines,
naming conventions, access rules (and more) are all defined based on
assignment to a Search Type.</p><p>The basic architecture of the TACTIC system is built around interaction
with objects through their Search Types. These objects or "instances of
a Search Type" are called Search Objects or <span class="strong"><strong>SObjects</strong></span>. The TACTIC
interface is simply a layer of widgets (tools) delivered through a web
browser that are provided for the user to search for SObjects, display
them, and interact with them based on their Search Types.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_delete"></a>13.16. Delete</h3></div></div></div><p>Deleting a Search Object revoves it from the database completely.
Although undoable, this is only right after doign so. If you are unsure,
retiring is ofter a good choice.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_task"></a>13.17. Task</h3></div></div></div><p>A task is any job that occurs within a process, and is the fundamental
atomic work element in project management. For details on tasks, go to
<span class="strong"><strong>Working with Tasks</strong></span>.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_notification"></a>13.18. Notification</h3></div></div></div><p>Notifications are triggers built to execute on specific configured
events, and can be internal to TACTIC (notification SObjects), or even
emails sent externally. Notifications can be configured to run based on
rules that define the conditions that must be met in order to send out a
message. Conditions help to streamline who receives a notification for a
particular event, as well as the conditions specific to the event.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_trigger"></a>13.19. Trigger</h3></div></div></div><p>Triggers are specific tools and scripts that are executed based on
events which occur in Tactic. Within the project setup, there are tools
which help setup triggers and notifications with simple tools. Although
if required, these Triggers can be quite complex. Using the TACTIC
Client API, you can achieve almost anything. For example, a trigger can
be called when a task’s status is changed. This type of trigger would
first check what the status was changed to, and then only proceed to
carry out a set of tasks if the status was, for example, "approved".
This may be as simple as changing the status of another task or as
complex as loading the final checkin for that task, render it to a video
file and then check it back into TACTIC.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_checkout"></a>13.20. Checkout</h3></div></div></div><p>Checkouts in Tactic is when a user requests a particular snapshot. This
request from the users standpoint can simply be a request for the
current material which prompts TACTIC to deliver all of the files as
well as any other dependant files to the user.</p><p>There are 2 ways for a user to actually retrieve the files for a
snapshot.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
The files can be loaded directly from the filesystem/fileserver.
This way, the files are not copied to the users machine, they are left
where they are and simply loaded up. For this to work, you would have to
have direct access to the Tactic assets directory but can be more
efficient as the files are not moved.
</li><li class="listitem">
The files can be downloaded to the local sandbox where a user can
work on them and save files however they like then when ready to commit
a checkin, do so through Tactic. The sandbox is good in situations where
the user is either off-site or there may be bandwidth issues opening the
files directly.
</li></ol></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_pipeline"></a>13.21. Pipeline</h3></div></div></div><p>Searchable Type metadata may also include a "pipeline_code" property to
link the SObject to a pipeline SObject. In this event, task SObjects are
also created from the pipeline’s processes to define the processes the
SObject will pass through as it progresses through its production. When
tasks (processes) are defined, they ensure that an asset can only move
along the pipeline with all checkpoints complete. For example, they can
determine that the assigned user checks in files, generates notes, sets
task status and receives management approvals. After all of the
associated tasks for the SObject are approved and it is packaged up and
marked complete, its production history information, files, and data are
all still available as a package.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_process"></a>13.22. Process</h3></div></div></div><p>A process is a definable phase in the pipeline of an asset. Processes
require some type of delivery upon completion, and often require that an
asset be checked in as part of the delivery mechanism. A process is
typically assigned to one person or one department. For large projects,
a single department could be assigned many processes.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_project_schema"></a>13.23. Project Schema</h3></div></div></div><p>The project schema defines the hierarchy between Search Types in TACTIC.
The schema definitions are stored in a "schema" SObject which stores the
parent and child relationships between the various Search Types in the
project. The schema is automatically updated when search_types are
created in TACTIC, and can be modified in a schema view.</p><p>Searchable Types define how you want to manage your objects and also
define a separation in pipelines, views, checkin methods and more. They
are some of the most important configuration aspects of TACTIC. The
majority of the TACTIC architecture is built around the use of search
types for the needs of the project as well as many of the system level
aspects.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_sandbox"></a>13.24. Sandbox</h3></div></div></div><p>The location on your workstation storing the files you are currently
working on.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_insert_2"></a>13.25. Insert</h3></div></div></div><p>When creating new Search Objects in your project, you are effectiavely
<span class="emphasis"><em>inserting</em></span> a new row into the database. If you insert a new Art
sObject, you are creating a new entry in the "art" table in your
project’s database.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_checkin"></a>13.26. Checkin</h3></div></div></div><p>Checkins in Tactic is generally the process of placing and registering
all of the files that represent a "snapshot" of that object. This
snapshot is a package in itself that understands all of the versioning
and location for all files and/or folders that are a part of that
checkin.</p><p>With the notion of each Search Object being a container, creating
snapshots can be compared to creating and storing packages in this
container.</p><p>From the back-end of Tactic the great aspect of this process is that
this package is simply meta data that points to where the actual files
and folders live in the file system. The main benefits of this that if
Tactic we to be shut off, the files system will still be available and
very well organized.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s12.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> </td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top"> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table></div></body></html>
