            <p>The General Check-in widget provides interface to do many of the most common kinds of
               check-ins used in TACTIC. It is a highly configurable widget that allows a project to
               have customized check-ins for any part of the content creation process.
            </p>
            <p>Check-ins are the ability to in TACTIC to take files that have been created and
                           submitting them to TACTIC's central repository to be organized, stored and versioned.
                           TACTIC has a comprehensive ability to track files and their histories with the added
                           benefit of enforcing naming conventions.

            <p>Check-ins for an item are always classified by a processes. TACTIC organizes all of
                           the check-ins with various processes that are defined for that item. The current process
                           can be selected by the process selection drop-down. This often times corresponds to a
                           task assigned to that user for that process.
            </p>
            <p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="media/checkin_process_select.png"></span></p>
            <p>This will only show up if a pipeline has been defined for the item. If no pipeline has
                           been defined, then a default process called "publish" is used.
            </p>
            <p>Often this selection will be locked because it is associated with an assigned task. A
                           user will often work from a task also associated within a particular process and then
                           choose to check in files based on content created from this task.

            <p>On first load of a new task (process) the check-in widget will assist the user in
                           setting up a work area. 
            </p>
            <p>The user experience protocol will determine how the user leverages the features in the
                           sandbox. The recommended approach is to allow TACTIC to create a sandbox location for
                           the current process. This method is beneficial because it helps the user organize
                           work-up files before they are even checked into the server. This approach is recommended
                           because it creates an easy accessible and well organized file system on the users
                           computer. It is however, possible to check in files from another location on the file
                           server using the browse buttons in the tool bar. 
            </p>
            <p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="media/checkin_first_load.png"></span></p>
            <p>During the content creation process, users will create files and save them under this
                           sandbox folder. All files associated with this item should be stored here. It should be
                           noted that this sandbox work area is not strictly enforced and it is easily possible to
                           navigate to other folders to check in files to a given asset. However, it is considered
                           good practice to have user's create files in a well defined location in order to more
                           easily manage overall disk space usage.
            </p>
            <p>Any files created in the sandbox area will be display in this section. If any new
                           files have been created and are not reflected in the interface, then a simple refresh
                           should make these new files appear.
            </p>
            <p>Files that have been checked-in will show a small indicator in the icon to the right
                           and will be colored in blue. The small indicator will either be a green check mark,
                           which indicates that the file in the sandbox is identical to the checked in file. If the
                           indicator is a red exclamation mark, this means that the file has been changed and is
                           different from the checked in file.
            </p>
            <p>To select all files in the sandbox area check off the "Select/Deselect All" check-box
                           on the top right hand side.

            <p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="media/checkin_select_all.png"></span></p>
            <p>To quickly select all changed files, click on the arrow to open up extra menus and
                           select "Select Changed Files".
            </p>
            <p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="media/checkin_changed_files.png"></span></p>
            <p>All files that have been changed since the last check-in will be selected. TACTIC will
                           remember the last subcontext checked in for this file so. This allows changed files to
                           be easily rechecked in when changes have been made.
            </p>
            <p>Clicking on the right mouse button of any file will open up a context menu.</p>

            <p>When all of the files that need to be checked in have been selected, the check in
                           widget will be enabled.
            </p>
            <p>It's good practice to add a note in the Description field while performing a check-in.
                           This is important so all project users understand why a particular check-in was made,
                           and where it's located.
            </p>
            <p>When the "Check-in" button is pressed, all of the selected files will be transferred
                           to TACTIC's repository. There are a number of ways that the files can be configured to
                           transfer files. When TACTIC checks in a file, it will move them to the correct folder,
                           version and rename them to the correct file name as specified for the naming
                           conventions.

            <p>When checking in, a drop-down is available beside each file or directory. This
                           functionality allows control over how each check-in will be handled. This type of
                           control is called <span class="bold"><strong>subcontext</strong></span>. This can be looked at as
                           a sub process for the sub-directories included in a check-in.

            <p>The "Auto" mode is used if it's desired to keep file names the same as they are before
                           the check in . This work-flow is beneficial if one wishes to keep file names, or work in
                           a situation such at subversion where files are constantly overwritten and versions are
                           handled automatically in the background.

            <p>When working on a particular task that is part of a pipeline, files may need to be
                           checked out or "downloaded" to be worked on or revised. TACTIC assists with this process
                           and allows easy access to retrieving the right files/directories from the TACTIC
                           server.
