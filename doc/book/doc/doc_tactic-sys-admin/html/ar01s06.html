compromised, even with rigorous security testing. TACTIC, in its current
version, has not been production tested for security scenarios outside
of completely trusted networks like intranets. This document does not
make any claims that TACTIC has any level of security beyond what its
current architecture design allows.</p><p>TACTIC is a bandwidth-intensive application, and client-server
performance will be affected by any number of network issues between the
client and the server.</p><p>There are numerous elements of functionality that go beyond utilizing
HTTP port access in enterprise applications of TACTIC. Many 3rd party
applications that communicate with TACTIC will produce unexpected
behavior when utilized in a fashion that was not intended for the

different security scenarios, the HTTP service must be configured for
use of these scenarios. Configuration files (usually called .htaccess

.htaccess file. Either way can be used. Apache provides modules for
LDAP, MySQL, flat-file, ADS, and many other authentication mechanisms.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>IIS</strong></span></p><p>IIS can be configured at the top level through the IIS snap-in, or by

contains information that control module loading, security
configuration, session state configuration, and application language and
compilation settings.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Overview</strong></span></p><p>TACTIC can be configured to use the SSL transport layer. This layer is
independent of the TACTIC service, and can be tailored to the needs of
the deployment without major changes to the TACTIC service.</p><p>Both major HTTP servers can be configured for SSL support. There are
many materials online available for configuration of the various flavors
of these two major HTTP service projects.</p><p>Since there are many different versions of these servers, a simple
search of “Windows 2003 IIS SSL�? as an example will yield many HOWTOs
and configuration references. Please consult the documentation for these
services.</p><p>The configuration examples that have been set out below are by no means
complete. Depending on the HTTP service used, and the platform used,
these examples may not be enough set directives or steps to properly
complete the SSL process. They are given as guides.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Steps</strong></span></p><p>The major steps to utilizing SSL in with TACTIC are</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

to be able to transmit information between the web site and the customer
in a manner that makes it difficult for other people to intercept and
read. SSL, or Secure Sockets Layer, takes care of this. It works through
a combination of programs and encryption/decryption routines that exist
on the web services host, and in browser programs (like Firefox and
Internet Explorer)</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Performance</strong></span></p><p>TLS has encryption/decryption routines as part of its security. These
routines can be bandwidth/CPU intensive. Any usage of TLS can compromise
TACTIC, if the routines are incorporated into the same host as the
TACTIC service. See guides on load-balancing for details on offsetting
this.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Overview</strong></span></p><p>A VPN will provide the most trouble-free access to TACTIC remotely. In
this scenario, the authentication/encryption routines are completely
removed from the realm of TACTIC configuration. This not only helps to
isolate TACTIC from complex configuration issues, but also allows for
isolated troubleshooting of remote access issues.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>PPTP</strong></span></p><p>PPTP is Microsoft supplied product. If an enterprise deployment of
TACTIC includes ADS authentication, then PPTP can be used as the VPN
transport layer. Usually, deployment is quite easily done. In PPTP,
usernames and passwords are used to complete the VPN link. PPTP can be
considered the “road-warrior�? VPN, meaning that it is easily deployed
to users.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>IPsec</strong></span></p><p>Ipsec is a suite of protocols used to secure data between hosts. A VPN
can be transported on top of this protocol. Typically, two remote hosts
are configured to communicate with each other, such as routers. This
type of VPN is typically used to connect two offices together.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Hardware VPNs</strong></span></p><p>Hardware VPNs such as offerings provided by companies like Cisco, can be
easily implemented. These Systems are designed for minimal ramp-up, and
can be implemented quickly.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Security Terms</strong></span></p><p>“is a form of active eavesdropping in which the attacker makes
independent connections with the victims and relays messages between
them, making them believe that they are talking directly to each other
over a private connection, when in fact the entire conversation is
controlled by the attacker. The attacker must be able to intercept all
messages going between the two victims and inject new ones, which is
straightforward in many circumstances (for example, an attacker within
reception range of an unencrypted Wi-Fi wireless access point, can
insert himself as a man-in-the-middle).�?</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>SSL (Wikipedia)</strong></span></p><p>“Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor, Secure Sockets

implementing virtual private networks. PPTP uses a control channel over
TCP and a GRE tunnel operating to encapsulate PPP packets.</p><p>The PPTP specification does not describe encryption or authentication
features and relies on the PPP protocol being tunneled to implement
security functionality. However the most common PPTP implementation,
shipping with the Microsoft Windows product families, implements various
levels of authentication and encryption natively as standard features of
the Windows PPTP stack. The intended use of this protocol is to provide
similar levels of security and remote access as typical VPN products.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>IPSEC (Wikipedia)</strong></span></p><p>Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is a protocol suite for securing
Internet Protocol (IP) communications by authenticating and encrypting
each IP packet of a data stream. IPsec also includes protocols for
establishing mutual authentication between agents at the beginning of
the session and negotiation of cryptographic keys to be used during the
session. IPsec can be used to protect data flows between a pair of hosts
(e.g. computer users or servers), between a pair of security gateways
(e.g. routers or firewalls), or between a security gateway and a
host.[1]</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_active_directory_integration"></a>6.3. Active Directory Integration</h3></div></div></div><p>TACTIC provides the ability to easily connect to any active directory
installation for both authentication and for synchronization of user
data. With a set of directives in the TACTIC configuration file, it is
possible to connect to Active Directory for authentication and user
information.</p><p>This synchronization takes place at login time. At this point, TACTIC
takes the desired information for a particular user and caches it into
the "sthpw/login" search type. Subsequent requests would normally use an
issued ticket given at login time. On these requests, no further
querying of active directory is needed until the ticket expires or the
user signs out the application.</p><p>The active directory modules make use of win32 libraries for python.
These must be installed in order for the connection to active directory
to function properly</p><p>There are a number of directives in the TACTIC config file that can be
used to configure the active directory settings. These allow you to
adjust TACTIC behavior to suit the needs of the facility.</p><p>In order to turn on active directory authentication, you must change the
authenticate class to the following:</p><p>authenticate_class: tactic.active_directory.ADAuthenticate</p><p>The following directives can be set under the active directory category:</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>domains:</strong></span> This is a "|" delimited list of the domains that exist in the
network. If specified, a selection box for domains will be added to the
login page.</p><p>*allow:*can be "all", which allows everyone to log in if authentication
is approved or it can point to the name of a specific Active Directory
attribute that must be set to True. If a person is denied access, the

Directory clearance".</p><p>*default_groups:*defines the default groups that a user will belong to
if none is specified. Multiple groups are delimited by "|".</p><p>*default_license_type:*determines the default license type for a user if
none is specified in the Active Directory attribute "tacticLicenceType".</p><p>Below is an example of a typical entry in the TACTIC config file:</p><p>&lt;active_directory&gt;</p><p>&lt;domains&gt;xxx|yyy|zzz&lt;/domains&gt;</p><p>&lt;allow&gt;tacticEnabled&lt;/allow&gt;</p><p>&lt;default_groups&gt;client&lt;/default_groups&gt;</p><p>&lt;default_license_type&gt;user&lt;/default_license_type&gt;</p><p>&lt;/active_directory&gt;</p><p>Allow anyone to login:</p><p>&lt;active_directory&gt;</p><p>&lt;allow&gt;all&lt;allow&gt;</p><p>&lt;/active_directory&gt;</p><p>Allow anyone to login and will be put in the "client" group if user has

TACTIC users lowercase with underscore separators for columns(
aaa_bbb_ccc). In order to maintain consistency within the TACTIC

provided. The following mappings are made by default:</p><div class="informaltable"><table cellpadding="4px" style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 3px solid #527bbd; border-bottom: 3px solid #527bbd; border-left: 3px solid #527bbd; border-right: 3px solid #527bbd; " width="100%"><colgroup><col class="col_1" /><col class="col_2" /></colgroup><tbody><tr><td style="border-right: 1px solid #527bbd; border-bottom: 1px solid #527bbd; " align="left" valign="top"><p>mail</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 1px solid #527bbd; " align="left" valign="top"><p>email</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 1px solid #527bbd; border-bottom: 1px solid #527bbd; " align="left" valign="top"><p>telephoneNumber</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 1px solid #527bbd; " align="left" valign="top"><p>phone_number</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 1px solid #527bbd; border-bottom: 1px solid #527bbd; " align="left" valign="top"><p>department</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 1px solid #527bbd; " align="left" valign="top"><p>department</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 1px solid #527bbd; border-bottom: 1px solid #527bbd; " align="left" valign="top"><p>displayName</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 1px solid #527bbd; " align="left" valign="top"><p>first_name, last_name (broken up)</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 1px solid #527bbd; " align="left" valign="top"><p>tacticLicenceType</p></td><td style="" align="left" valign="top"><p>license_type</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Active Directory variable "tacticLicenseType" is a custom variable
that indicates which type of license a particular user can occupy in
TACTIC. If this attribute is missing from a users active directory
profile, then they will be denied a login. This attribute can be used to
determine if a particular user in active directory is allowed to login
to TACTIC.</p><p>The only supported license for this attribute are "user" and "default".
Other license types have not yet been implemented yet.</p><p>On log in, TACTIC will look at all of the groups that a user belongs to
in Active Directory and match those group names to the "ad_login_group"
column in the "sthpw/login_group" search type. This grouping list will
synchronized at this time, removing the users from groups not specified
in Active Directory and add those that are specified. This means that
Active Directory is in full control of the groups that a user is part of
and therefore must be managed entirely in Active Directory.</p><p>For the name of the group, TACTIC only looks at the root of the path to
map the group name. For example, an active directory group with the
following distinguished name:</p><p>memberOf: CN=supervisor,OU=Users,OU=EIS,DC=domain,DC=us,DC=xxxx,DC=com</p><p>TACTIC will need only "supervisor" to be entered in the "ad_login_group"
column.</p><p>If on logging in, the number of users exceeds the number of users in the
license, then that user will be denied access and an entry in the
"sthpw/login" search type will not be made. However, all other users
currently registered can continue to work normally.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_configuring_tactic_and_co_services"></a>6.4. Configuring TACTIC and Co-Services</h3></div></div></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>TACTIC Service Configuration</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Overview</strong></span></p><p>Multiple TACTIC servers can be leveraged in environments where there is

installation can map on to any number of external databases and use them
as a database resource. These database resources are treated as first
class citizens in the TACTIC. All of the features that are inherent to
any native TACTIC data are also available to these external database
resources. To implement this functionality, db_resource can be used to
connect a project to a database resource. It defines the location and
connection credentials to access a database server. Database resources
can be added under the side bar menu <span class="strong"><strong>Global → Database Resource</strong></span>.</p><p>Specify (or look up) the Database Resource under <span class="strong"><strong>Admin Views →
Global</strong></span>.</p><p>The database resource entry in Database Resource contains all the
information needed to connect to a database. In order for TACTIC to
access another database, it has to have a database resource registered
and then it has to be mapped to a project.</p><p>In the example below, the new database’s code is named:
<span class="strong"><strong>my_new_db_resource</strong></span>, which is the reference of this entry. Host, which
refers to the IP address of the server, is set to be a tested address.
The Login and Password are the information used to log in the database.</p><p>Since all TACTIC projects have a single database resource that it uses
as a persistent store for sObjects. By default, the project will use the
same resource as the sthpw database and is defined in the TACTIC
config file. However, this can be configured to point to another
database resource.</p><p>Note that the search type uses a project to find the corresponding
database. Any project configured to look at a database resource with the
db_resource and database columns. The db resource defines the connection
criteria and the column determines which database to connect to that
resource.</p><p>To add new a database as pure resource database, Specify (or look up)
the <span class="emphasis"><em>Add Project</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Projects</em></span> columns under <span class="strong"><strong>Admin Views → Global →
Database Resource</strong></span>.</p><p>In the example below, the new database called <span class="strong"><strong>test_database001</strong></span> from
the db_resource <span class="strong"><strong>my_new_db_resource</strong></span> has been added to a Project called
<span class="strong"><strong>Testing</strong></span>.</p><p>For a project to become a full TACTIC project (complete with separate
URL space: <code class="literal">http://&lt;server&gt;/&lt;project&gt;</code> and separate themes an interfaces),
all that is required is the config tables to exist in that database
resource. Thus a database resource can start off as a data source and
then, at any time, be upgraded to a full TACTIC project if that is ever
required by importing the appropriate config tables that the search type
uses in the project to find the corresponding database. The project is
configured to look at a database resource with the db_resource and
database column. The db resource defines the connection criteria and
the column determines which database to connect to on that resource.</p><p>In order for TACTIC to access another database, it has to have a
database resource registered and then it has to be mapped to a project.
This mapping is currently required because all search types are scoped
and searched using the notation:</p><pre class="screen">&lt;namespace&gt;/&lt;table&gt;?project=&lt;project&gt;&amp;code=&lt;code&gt;</pre><p>An example search_type entry would be:</p><pre class="screen">jobs/media?project=my_test_project</pre></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_remoteaccesstactic"></a>6.8. RemoteAccessTactic</h3></div></div></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s05.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s07.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top"> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table></div></body></html>
