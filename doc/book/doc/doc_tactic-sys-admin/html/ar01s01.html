production environment:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

</li></ul></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>What Makes TACTIC Scalable?</strong></span></p><p>The TACTIC platform uses web technologies in its underlying
architecture. As proven by many popular web sites today, web
technologies are able to scale to a large number of users—to levels far
beyond the size of any large installation today requiring TACTIC.</p><p>The TACTIC user interface and its API (Application Programmer Interface)
are both built on web technologies. A web server controls as the user
front end., and accesses a back-end database. Web servers can handle
high volumes, so scalability is not an issue—especially for the
relatively manageable volume seen in even the largest of digital
productions.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Web server technology</strong></span></p><p>TACTIC uses a web server to deliver static content to users, who are
able to access TACTIC over the web. Web servers are capable of
delivering enormous numbers of requests, and will remain stable during
heavy loads. Web servers by definition are the most efficient vehicles
for web delivery, and TACTIC technology is optimized to take advantage
of this technology for fast execution and scalability.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Leading database technology</strong></span></p><p>TACTIC stores all persistent data in either Oracle or PostgreSQL
databases, products that both have proven track records in the most
demanding of production environments.</p><p>Today’s databases coupled with today’s hardware are sufficiently
powerful to handle any of today’s production needs. The largest of
digital productions cannot come close to exceeding the data limits of a
typical database.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Optimized requests</strong></span></p><p>With digital productions, the amount of data required is seldom the
issue. Rather, bottlenecks are typically caused by complex requests
slowing down database response time. Digital productions tend to use
deeply nested and enormously complex relationships between various
pieces of data. It is this complexity that tends to slow down
applications that try to parse this data in a meaningful human way,
creating complex requests that slow down database response.</p><p>TACTIC is designed from the ground up to master the complexities of
digital productions. For every request, it builds a unique
object-relational mapper specifically designed for the needs of high
volume, large scale digital production asset management solutions.</p><p>TACTIC is flexible enough to handle the complex relationships between
any part of the production pipeline, and has proven itself in
large-scale projects using extremely complex data.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Easy code maintenance</strong></span></p><p>The Python programming language is used for TACTIC application
development. Python has many strengths that contribute to ease of
maintenance (courtesy of www.python.org):</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

possible across cores and across multiple machines, and enables TACTIC
to scale to large enterprise environments.</p><p>(For details and examples, see <span class="strong"><strong>TACTIC Scalable Configuration
Examples</strong></span>.)</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Segregating services</strong></span></p><p>The various TACTIC services can be segregated to run independently of
each other. This allows important services, such as user interface
requests, to access their own resources and not be slowed down by other
more resource-intensive services such as render farms.</p><p>(For details and examples, see <span class="strong"><strong>Scalable TACTIC Deployments</strong></span>.)</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Types of Scalability</strong></span></p><p>There are several types of scalability that are considerations with the
use of Python as the TACTIC programming language:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
Code scalability: TACTIC contains thousands of classes and many
hundreds of thousands of lines of code which are facilitated by use of
the Python language. There has been no reason to believe that the code
base cannot continue to scale to meet software needs for the foreseeable
future.
</li><li class="listitem">
Memory scalability: Python is known for large memory requirements when
compared to other languages, but the required memory for TACTIC code is
much smaller than that found on typical servers, and has seldom been an
issue.
</li><li class="listitem">
Performance scalability: Python’s GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) limits
Python’s scalability across multiple threads. This limitation has been
long discussed in newsgroups, with the general consensus that
scalability is achieved much more easily by load-balancing across
processes rather than across threads. TACTIC enables easy load balancing
across processes to achieve full linear scalability.
</li><li class="listitem">
Maintenance scalability: Clean and clear syntax makes it easy to
refactor and maintain code over the long term. Experience has shown that
our code base is very accessible to new developers, providing confidence
that code base knowledge can be maintained over the years.
</li></ul></div><p>Overall, very few limitations with the Python language itself have been
encountered and have easily circumvented its lack of scalability across
multiple threads by optimizing proper load balancing across processes.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Additional Scalability Considerations</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Availability</strong></span></p><p>TACTIC has been designed to be highly stable even under extremely heavy
stress. It has been tested and tuned on several projects in environments
of high stress and high load and has been proven to run under duress
without going down.</p><p>As with any piece of software, there is always a point a failure—there
are a number of legitimate reasons for a TACTIC server becoming
unresponsive or even going down:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
network cutoff
</li><li class="listitem">
power failure
</li><li class="listitem">
physical memory failure
</li><li class="listitem">
overloaded requests for the available resources
</li></ul></div><p>For projects that require high availability even in the event of
catastrophic failure, there are a number of hardware solutions to
provide failover should the primary resource fail. These hardware
solutions will instantly redirect requests to a redundant resource,
thereby providing continuous service to the users.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Memory requirements</strong></span></p><p>Each available process will use a certain amount of memory, so a balance
must be struck between the number of processes and the size of the
complete in-memory TACTIC footprint on the server. In other words,
adding more processes may or may not increase the availability of TACTIC
if memory is an issue. If processes start running into swap space,
performance will be severely affected.</p><p>As memory usage becomes an issue, the choice will be to load balance
over multiple machines (see <span class="strong"><strong>Scalable TACTIC Deployments</strong></span>).</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Database Replication</strong></span></p><p>Both Oracle and Postgres have replication capability: the ability to
distribute the processing load of the database server over a number of
machines. Database replication is complex and should not be taken
lightly. With the advent of multiprocessor and multi-cores systems, the
need for database replication has been reduced significantly. It is
often much cheaper and less time consuming to increase the
processors/cores of a server than it is to configure a database for
replication.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_scalable_tactic_deployment_planning"></a>1.2. Scalable TACTIC Deployment Planning</h3></div></div></div><p>The stages of a TACTIC deployment are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

</li><li class="listitem">
2. Determining hardware requirements

3. Determining TACTIC Service and Co-Service Locations
</li><li class="listitem">
4. Post Deployment TACTIC upscaling
</li></ul></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Planning NOTES</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Determining TACTIC Usage Requirements</strong></span></p><p>One of the first questions asked in a TACTIC deployment is "what kind of
deployment is required?" This is a hard question to answer unless it is
known beforehand exactly how TACTIC will be used. Since every TACTIC
deployment is customized by the licensee, there is really no way to
calculate accurately the type of load that will eventually be placed on
the TACTIC server. Fortunately, due to TACTIC’s scalable architecture, a
TACTIC deployment can be scaled up easily when there are unforeseen
increases in usage.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Service Requirements</strong></span></p><p>In a TACTIC deployment, running the TACTIC service is the primary
function of the TACTIC host machine. The co-services can be deployed to
the location most appropriate for the environment. However, to ensure
scalability and high availability, the co-services should not be
deployed on the TACTIC host for any but the smallest of deployments.</p><p>TACTIC uses four major services and co-services in its operation:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
TACTIC service: provides the API and GUI widget system.
</li><li class="listitem">
Database co-service: provides indexing and storage for asset meta
data.
</li><li class="listitem">
HTTP co-service: provides delivery (and return) of raw asset data.
</li><li class="listitem">
Assets storage co-service: provides storage and back-up capabilities
of raw asset data.
</li></ul></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Limitations</strong></span></p><p>With TACTIC, you can simply add hardware and load-balance it to handle
more and more requests. You can expand scalability in this way until the
database server itself becomes the bottleneck. Fortunately, with the
introduction of multi-CPU and multi-core machines, database limits are
extremely high.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>User Interfaces:</em></span> For applications with end-user interfaces (especially
those using widgets, where complex interface elements need to be
constructed), the load required to process TACTIC requests will remain
much greater than the load required to process SQL calls, no matter how
much hardware is added to handle such requests.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Client APIs:</em></span> Client APIs provide a much thinner layer to the database
and so are optimized to handle lower level requests very rapidly.
However, because API calls are typically used for automated processes,
they can generate a large number of requests quickly, creating a heavy
load on the TACTIC server.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Load balancing:</em></span> this is especially important for render farms, which
can be massive in scale with thousands to tens of thousands of cores. It
ensures that the high volume of requests is evenly distributed to all of
the available TACTIC processes. The exact number of processes required
to handle the high volume is highly dependent on the number of requests
made and to the complexity of the requests. However, because load
balancing will provide near-linear scalability, the number of processes
can be increased to a level that is sufficient for the number of
requests being demanded of the client API.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Report generation:</em></span> TACTIC’s reporting system is powerful and
comprehensive, and the load on host CPUs can increase significantly when
complex reports are being run. Administrators should focus on report
generation when investigating load utilization.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Checkins:</em></span> There are two kinds of complexity when considering
scalability for checkins:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
Large Checkins: TACTIC offers a wide variety of checkin configurations
that will accommodate large bandwidth, large files, and complex
dependency between files.
</li><li class="listitem">
Many Checkins: There are few concerns with a large number of checkins.
The number of checkins that occur even in the largest of productions is
small compared to the limits of a database.
</li></ul></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Determining TACTIC Hardware Requirements</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Hardware Overview</strong></span></p><p>TACTIC works well with most types of hardware, but industry-standard
server level components are highly recommended. The exact configuration
will depend on the specific needs of your facility.</p><p>For most deployments, TACTIC can be installed on the typical commodity
hardware used by most small and large enterprises. TACTIC is a
purpose-built relational database at its core, and your hardware choices
can reflect that fact.</p><p>TACTIC service requirements: Assuming TACTIC is the only service on the
host, the minimal requirements for a production-level deployment of a
TACTIC host are:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
CPU: dual core
</li><li class="listitem">
Memory: 4G
</li><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
Disk space needed for TACTIC to run on: 10G
</p><p class="simpara">(assets should be stored elsewhere, on an enterprise quality server)</p></li></ul></div><p>These requirements represent the recommended absolute minimal hardware
required to run a basic TACTIC service in a production environment. For
development and testing, TACTIC will run on most hardware including
laptops.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Asset storage:</em></span> It is highly recommended that assets be stored on an
enterprise-quality, high-availability server, and not on the TACTIC
host.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>RAID Options:</em></span> You can use various RAID configurations to maximize
reliability and performance. For example, you could locate the Operating
System on one physical drive, and the database files on another. Or you
could locate the database on a RAID array.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Asset meta data:</em></span> The amount of asset meta data stored on disk by
TACTIC is insignificant to today’s hardware specifications and need not
be a consideration when choosing a server: reliability and performance
should be higher concerns.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Determining TACTIC Service Locations</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Segregating Services</strong></span></p><p>TACTIC offers a number of different services for different purposes. For
example, the TACTIC server can serve out complex widgets, serve out
large numbers of client API requests and perform large, complex
check-ins.</p><p>Each type of service has distinct needs, so it is often beneficial to
segregate the services to be independent of each other. This allows each
service to operate within a pool of assigned resources without affecting
(or being affected by) the other services.</p><p>For example, if a render farm used a client API script that heavily
loaded the TACTIC server and its requests were shared with user
interface requests, users would experience inconsistent (and
occasionally unacceptably slow) response times. This experience would
cause frustration amongst users, so it would be necessary to segregate
their user interface service from the render farm’s client API service.</p><p>Each type of service has very different demands and needs, so
segregating services also allows you to tune the hardware and software
to the specifications required for the service they are handling.
Ultimately, you can maximize the use of your available resources.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>How Load Balancing Works</strong></span></p><p>Load balancing distributes requests to various TACTIC processes using an
algorithm that determines which request is delegated to which process.
The default algorithm is a very simple randomizer.</p><p>For most applications, the default algorithm works perfectly fine. It is
left to chance whether a particular request will be assigned to a
heavily loaded process or one that is sitting idle, so there may be
inconsistent performance depending on load and availability of TACTIC
processes not already loaded.</p><p>IIS delegation algorithms (on MSWeb Server) are also supported. For
Apache, an example algorithm is provided you can customize to your
needs.</p><p>Each process, by default, is assigned two simultaneous requests at most.
This limit has proven in production to be the most effective because it
prevents the Python process itself from being overloaded waiting for
required I/O operations. If there are excess requests waiting to be
processed, they are kept in a queue and assigned sequentially to
processes as they become available.</p><p>Python’s GIL (global interpreter lock) prevents any Python process from
using more than one CPU or core, so the number of threads available for
any given process is limited. True scalability is achieved by
load-balancing requests over multiple processes. This method scales
seamlessly and linearly over multiple cores, multiple CPUs and
ultimately over multiple physical servers with only simple configuration
changes.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Post Deployment TACTIC Upscaling</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Scenarios</strong></span></p><p>TACTIC is easily upscaled in most post deployment scenarios. Upscaling
does not require any significant downtime of TACTIC services.</p><p>Some scenario examples follow, with bullet points outlining why these
possible solutions would be followed;</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Increasing number of TACTIC processes on a single machine</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Splitting TACTIC into multiple servers from one server</strong></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
