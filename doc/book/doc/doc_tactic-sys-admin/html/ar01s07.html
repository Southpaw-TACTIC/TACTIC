the TACTIC service. Versioned assets are by far the most disk space
consuming element of asset management. TACTIC can store its asset data
in any filesystem path location. All that is required is that the tactic
configuration file contains the path to a directory writable by the
TACTIC service user.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
<span class="strong"><strong>Local Access</strong></span> in a simple configuration, the TACTIC service is
enabled on the TACTIC host, and all assets checked in and checked out of
TACTIC are stored on the local filesystem. Typically a user is created
to run the TACTIC service, or an already assigned user is simply used to
run the TACTIC service.
</li><li class="listitem">
<span class="strong"><strong>Network Access</strong></span> in an addition to the simple configuration, the
TACTIC service is enabled on the tactic host and all assets checked in
and checked out tactic are stored on a network mount. Typically a user
is created to run the TACTIC service and be able to write to the network
mount.
</li><li class="listitem">
*TACTIC user permissions*It is important to note that in a network
accessible filesystem, allocation of permissions are important only for
the TACTIC user. Regular system users should not have access to the
TACTIC assets directory.
</li><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
<span class="strong"><strong>Browsable access to assets</strong></span> During some conversions to the management
of assets by TACTIC, a frequent request is for regular user access to
the assets directory managed by TACTIC. There really is not the much to
see in these directories as tactics naming convention for versioning of
assets creates files and directories that are largely mysterious in
their arrangement.
</p><p class="simpara">Is very important that the files that are managed by tactic are not
touched by regular users. Manipulating files or directories managed by
tactic will definitely result in data loss. Regular users should not
have writable access to tactic asset directories.</p></li></ul></div><p>Before you begin this process, you should first move or copy your assets
to their new location using a network share ideally named <span class="emphasis"><em>assets</em></span>. For
a new installation, you should create an <span class="emphasis"><em>assets</em></span> share or directory in
your new location.</p><p>In most cases, it is ideal to relocate the <code class="literal">assets</code> directory to a
dedicated file server. If you already have an assets directory, you can
rename it to "assets_temp" to break the current connection. You will
know the connection is broken when your asset and project thumbnails are
no longer visible in the user interface. Once the assets are
successfully moved to the new location you will know they are accessible
when the assets and thumbnails are visible again.</p><p>In Linux, the steps to rename the current assets will be similar to the
example below:</p><p>\1) Navigate to the apache directory <code class="literal">cd /home/apache</code></p><p>\2) In the shell run <code class="literal">mv assets assets_bak</code></p><p>\3) If you run <code class="literal">ls -la</code>, you should get a listing confirming the change</p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="media/renameAssetsToAssetsBak.png" alt="image" /></span></p><p>\4) To confirm the operation was successful, log in to TACTIC and you
should find that none of the thumbnails or assets are available.</p><p>The config file is named differently on each operating system:</p><div class="informaltable"><table cellpadding="4px" style="border-collapse: collapse;border-top: 3px solid #527bbd; border-bottom: 3px solid #527bbd; border-left: 3px solid #527bbd; border-right: 3px solid #527bbd; "><colgroup><col class="col_1" /><col class="col_2" /><col class="col_3" /></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="border-right: 1px solid #527bbd; border-bottom: 1px solid #527bbd; " align="left" valign="top">Filename </th><th style="border-right: 1px solid #527bbd; border-bottom: 1px solid #527bbd; " align="left" valign="top">Operating System </th><th style="border-bottom: 1px solid #527bbd; " align="left" valign="top">Location</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="border-right: 1px solid #527bbd; border-bottom: 1px solid #527bbd; " align="left" valign="top"><p>tactic_win32-conf.xml</p></td><td style="border-right: 1px solid #527bbd; border-bottom: 1px solid #527bbd; " align="left" valign="top"><p>Windows</p></td><td style="border-bottom: 1px solid #527bbd; " align="left" valign="top"><p>TACTIC_INSTALL_DIR/projects/config</p></td></tr><tr><td style="border-right: 1px solid #527bbd; " align="left" valign="top"><p>tactic_linux-conf.xml</p></td><td style="border-right: 1px solid #527bbd; " align="left" valign="top"><p>Linux</p></td><td style="" align="left" valign="top"><p>TACTIC_INSTALL_DIR/projects/config</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Updating the tactic_linux-conf.xml file (Linux)</strong></span></p><p>In the <code class="literal">&lt;checkin/&gt;</code> tag in the <code class="literal">tactic_linux-conf.xml</code> config file, the
