         <p><span class="bold"><strong>Note:</strong></span> The default is to email the person that causes the
                    notification to fire through the event set up. To turn off this behavior, you can add an
                    entry in Project Setting: key = email_to_sender  , value = false.
         </p>
         <p>Below are examples of what can be used in <span class="italic">mail_to</span>,
                        <span class="italic">mail_cc</span>, or <span class="italic">mail_bcc</span>:
         </p>
         <p>For example, email the user 'admin' only:</p>
         <p>
                    
         </p><pre class="screen">@SOBJECT(sthpw/login['login', 'admin'])</pre><p>
                
         </p>
         <p>For example, send to the user related to this sObject. If this is an event for task
                    update, the email will be addressed to the assigned user:
         </p>
         <p>
                    
         </p><pre class="screen">@SOBJECT(sobject.sthpw/login)</pre><p>
                
         </p>
         <p>If it is already a task for the event update|sthpw/task, which contains the assigned or
                    supervisor attribute, the email will be addressed to both by just retrieving these
                    attributes in two lines.
         </p>
         <p>
                    
         </p><pre class="screen">@GET(sobject.assigned)
@GET(sobject.supervisor)</pre><p>
                
         </p>
         <p>Let's say you want something simpler and skip the use of task. If you have an sType called mystuff/manager that already contains
            an email address or comma separated email addresses in an attribute called email, you may want to email to the dedicated manager
            for a paricular shot. 
                    Assuming your shot sType mystuff/shot and mystuff/manager has a schema connection already, you can email them when
            updating your shot with the event update|mystuff/shot. 
         </p>
         <p>
                    
         </p><pre class="screen">@GET(sobject.mystuff/manager.email)</pre><p>
                
         </p>
         <p>If you want to email to the same manager David and a person named Carin defined in Users when updating any shots with the
            event update|mystuff/shot, there is no need to start off with the variable sobject representing the shot in transaction.
         </p>
         <p>
                    
         </p><pre class="screen">@GET(mystuff/manager['first_name']['David'].email)
@GET(sthpw/login['first_name']['Carin'].email)</pre><p>
                
         </p>
         <p>For example, send to the user related to this sObject as well as the user 'john'. If the
                    event is insert|sthpw/note, it will be the person who enters the note. If the event is
                    'update|sthpw/task', the person is the assignee of the task:
         </p>
         <p>
                    
         </p><pre class="screen">@UNION(@SOBJECT(sthpw/login['login', 'john']), @SOBJECT(sobject.sthpw/login))</pre><p>
                
         </p>
         <p>To make these mail_to expressions more readable, put more than 1 expression or email
                    addresses on multiple lines. There is no need for @UNION. @GET can even be used to just get
                    to the list of login names.
         </p>
         <p>For example, to send to everyone in the supervisor group, the assignee of a task, to all
                    the users in the <span class="bold"><strong>mangers</strong></span> group and the email address
                    support@southpawtech.com, enter 3 lines under mail_to:
         </p>
         <p>
                    
         </p><pre class="screen">@SOBJECT(sobject.sthpw/login)
@GET(sthpw/login_in_group['login_group','supervisor'].login)
managers
support@southpawtech.com</pre><p>
                
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p><span class="bold"><strong>More on Expressions in Notifications</strong></span></p>
         <p>The word "sobject" often appears in the <span class="italic">Mail to:</span> column
                    but not in Message or Subject. This is because the implementation allows sending
                    notifications to users related to the current sObject or just about anyone not necessarily
                    related to the current sObject. As illustrated above, @SOBJECT(sobject.sthpw/login) is the
                    task assignee but the users under the group supervisor is not related to this task and so
                    the keyword "sobject" is not used. In the Message area, to refer to the current sObject
                    status (task status if the event is update|sthpw/task), just use an @GET(.status), as the
                    sobject is always assumed to be in this context.
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p><span class="bold"><strong>Task related notification</strong></span></p>
         <p>To establish the relationship between the login search type and task search type, the
                    following built-in schema line is used. It is not necessary to add it to the schema. It can
                    be used as an example to create a custom search_type.

         <p>To establish the relationship between the login search type and note search type, the

         </p>
         <p>Sending a notification to the person who just entered the note is not often used. Instead,
                    an email handler can be used in this situation to send to the supervisor and assignee of the
                    task under the same context. A built-in email handler is called
                    "pyasm.command.NoteEmailHandler". Instead of entering it into an expression for <span class="italic">mail_to</span>, enter it into the <span class="italic">email_handler_class</span> field. 
         </p>

         <p>Once the fields <span class="italic">event</span>, <span class="italic">mail_to</span>, and <span class="italic">message</span> are
                    properly filled in, to test the email, click on the <span class="bold"><strong>Email

                    as well as reporting any email server error if the service section of the TACTIC config file
                    has not been properly filled in. Settings like firewall and TLS settings may also block an
                    email from being sent out.

         <p>TACTIC uses the TACTIC Expression Language to build dynamic Notification Subject and

                    Search Objects it is being sent for.
         </p>
         <p>In the simple example Subject below, the "id" property is used from the "ticket" search
                    object.
         </p><pre class="screen">TACTIC Ticket {$GET(.id)} has been updated</pre><p>The expected results of this would be similar to the following:</p>

         </h6>
         <p>In essence, anything between the curly brackets "{}" is evaluated as an expression by

         <h3><a name="d0e6394"></a>Filtering Notifications
         </h3>
         <p>TACTIC's notification architecture is a rules-based system built using the trigger
                    architecture. Every time a command is executed, TACTIC looks through the list of defined
                    triggers (including notifications) for a match. Under the <span class="bold"><strong>Triggers</strong></span> view will be an entry for the EmailTrigger class that is registered
                    under the "email" event. It is possible to create custom Email Trigger handlers in that
                    view.
         </p>
         <p>There are 3 main criteria used to filter out notifications:</p>
         <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul class="itemizedlist">
               <li class="listitem">
                  <p><span class="bold"><strong>group</strong></span>: Filters out notifications to be sent only
                                     to users in the included groups.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li class="listitem">
                  <p><span class="bold"><strong>project</strong></span>: Filters out notifications so that only a
                                     certain project can fire the email trigger.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li class="listitem">
                  <p><span class="bold"><strong>rules</strong></span>: Rules are an XML snippet which can finely
                                     control the conditions when an email trigger may be fired.
                  </p>
               </li>
            </ul>
         </div>
         <h3><a name="d0e6419"></a>Groups
         </h3>
         <p>By planning groups to send notifications to, it allows for simple connections for
                    deciphering which groups of users will receive notifications when the conditions of a
                    particular notification rule are met. Once a notification has been created, it can be
                    associated with any number of groups of users. All users in this group will then be sent a
                    notification when the rule is triggered.
         </p>
         <p>The Groups view can be found under:</p>
         <p>
                    <span class="bold"><strong>Admin-&gt;Site Admin -&gt;Groups </strong></span></p>
         <p>To specify a group to send a notification to, specify the group in the <span class="bold"><strong>mail_to</strong></span> column.
         </p>
         <h6><a name="d0e6434"></a>Project
         </h6>
         <p>By setting the project in the project column of a Notification, TACTIC will only use the
                    notification trigger for the chosen project.
         </p>
         <h6><a name="d0e6438"></a>Access Rules 
         </h6>
         <p>When a notification rule has passed all of the criteria, a message is constructed. Most
                    email events occur after a command has been completed. The email handler then takes the
                    information from the command and creates a default message to be sent to the appropriate
                    people.
         </p>
         <p>All rules are contained in groups. For notifications, there are a few predefined
                    groups:
         </p>
         <h6><a name="d0e6444"></a>Example 1 
         </h6>
         <p>This rule group only allows tasks for prod/asset for the project sample3d to send out
                    notification. Otherwise, it would send out notifications for tasks of all search
                    types
         </p><pre class="screen">&lt;rules&gt;
   &lt;rule&gt;@GET(.search_type)=='prod/asset?project=sample3d'&lt;/rule&gt;
&lt;/rules&gt;</pre><h6><a name="d0e6450"></a>Example 2
         </h6>
         <p>This rule group makes use of a key/value pair of attributes: that is, when the attribute
                    with the value of "key" is equal to "value", the rule is passed. In the example below, all
                    SObjects containing the attribute "context" with the value "client" are triggered.
         </p><pre class="screen"> (deprecated)

&lt;rules&gt;
    &lt;rule group="SObject" key="context" value="client"/&gt;
&lt;/rules&gt;</pre><pre class="screen">&lt;rules&gt;
    &lt;rule&gt;@GET(.context)=='client'&lt;/rule&gt;
&lt;/rules&gt;</pre><h6><a name="d0e6458"></a>Example 3
         </h6>
         <p>For certain SObjects in TACTIC (like tasks), parent attributes can be used for
                    constructing rules. The concept behind this is the same as group="sObject", but now we are
                    referring to the parent of a task (for example, a 3D asset). This notification will only be
                    sent if the task's parent, a 3D asset, is categorized under the "prp" asset library.
         </p><pre class="screen">&lt;!-- DEPRICATED --&gt;                
&lt;rules&gt;
    &lt;rule group='parent' key='asset_library' value='prp'/&gt;
&lt;/rules&gt;</pre><pre class="screen">&lt;rules&gt;
    &lt;rule&gt;@GET(prod/asset.asset_library)=='prp'&lt;rule&gt;
&lt;/rules&gt;</pre><h6><a name="d0e6467"></a>Example 4
         </h6>
         <p>For notes in TACTIC, we may have 2 processes for notes (e.g. anim, anim_2) We can check if
                    the process partially contains the word <span class="bold"><strong>anim</strong></span> by the
                    following:
         </p><pre class="screen">&lt;rules&gt;
    &lt;rule&gt;'anim' in @GET(.process)&lt;rule&gt;
&lt;/rules&gt;</pre><p>Note: list comparisons like @GET(.process) in ['anim','anim_2'] are not supported</p>
         <h6><a name="d0e6478"></a>Example 5
         </h6>
         <p>For a check-in notification in TACTIC, we can choose to send only if the is_current
                    attribute is True for the event insert|sthpw/snapshot by the following:
         </p><pre class="screen">&lt;rules&gt;
    &lt;rule&gt;@GET(.is_current)==True&lt;rule&gt;
&lt;/rules&gt;</pre><h5><a name="d0e6484"></a>Email Handler Class
         </h5>
         <p>Each time a notification is executed, TACITC uses either the default email handler or it
                    uses and email handler override defined by the Email Handler Class property for the
                    notification. 
         </p>
         <p>The Email Handler Class digs deeply into the structure of the notifications using Python
                    and the TACTIC client API. It is only needed for very specific rules which determine when a
                    notification is sent.
         </p>
         <p>An example override is shown below:</p>
         <p><span class="bold"><strong>Email Hander Cls:</strong></span>
                    sites.support.email.TicketEmailHandler
