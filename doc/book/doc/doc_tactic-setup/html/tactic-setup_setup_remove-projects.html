         <p>There is no user interface in TACTIC to remove a project. This is because the complete
            removal of a project has some pretty significant consequences. When a project is created, a
            number of elements are created. These are listed below.
         </p>
         <div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
            <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
            <p>This task may need to be carried out by the Tactic System Admin as it involves
                           manually accessing both the Tactic File system and the Tactic Database
            </p>
         </div>
         <p>In all of the following examples, &lt;project_code&gt; represents the code of the project
                    when the project was created.
         </p>
         <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul class="itemizedlist">
               <li class="listitem">
                  <p>A database called &lt;project_code&gt;</p>

         <p><span class="bold"><strong>A complete removal of a project should be handled with care. This is
                              most often desirably when a project has been created in properly. It is one of the few
                              operations that is not undo-able in TACTIC, so it is recommended to be careful when
                              proceeding with the following steps. It is also recommended that a complete backup of
                              TACTIC is performed before carrying out this process.</strong></span></p>

         <p>In this process, Tactic may not allow removing a particular project due to there being
                    child tasks, notes, snapshots, files, wdg_settings etc. If Tactic denies revoval because,
                    for example there is a connection in the file table, you will need to do the
                    following
         </p><pre class="screen">delete from file where project_code='&lt;project_code&gt;';
delete from snapshot where project_code='&lt;project_code&gt;';
