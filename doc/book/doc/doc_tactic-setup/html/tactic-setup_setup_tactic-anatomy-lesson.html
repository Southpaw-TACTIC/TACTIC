         <p>TACTIC is a project-based system that can be configured to accommodate the custom
                    requirements of many different project scenarios. 
         </p>
         <p>Any project or asset management scenario can have a large number of items to manage. These
                  items can be people, files, tasks or information and the management of these items are often
                    a hurdle. The primary goal of TACTIC is to assist in generating placeholders, controlling
                    workflow and managing these items.

                           housed in your facility as a website which runs on your private network, or can be
                           opened up to the world wide web like any other website.
            </p>
            <p>For Tactic to run there are 4 main services:</p>

            </h4>
            <p>The Project workflow is a layout of a pipeline processes. &nbsp;Each pipeline defines a
                           set of processes that a single object can travel through. These pipelines also represent
                           the dependencies between the processes. For example, each process inherently knows which
                           processes are upstream, and which are downstream. This can be leveraged with automated
                           notifications, emails, status updates and external trigger processing tools.
            </p>
            <p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="media/tactic-anatomy_project-workflow.png"></span></p>
            <p>The Project Schema and the Project Workflow Editor are connected. The Schema is used
                           to layout the sTypes individually, and the Work-flow Editor is used to create the
                           pipelines the sTypes will flow through.

            <p><span class="bold"><strong>What are "sTypes"?</strong></span></p>
            <p>Within the schema for a project there are various "types" of manageable objects that
                           are defined when a node is created. These items are called Searchable Types (sTypes).
                           Each of these Types are actually a table in the database and each column represents a
                           property relevant to that sType. 
            </p>
            <p>A project configuration can have various views, pipelines, naming conventions, access
                           rules etc, which are all defined based on an assignment to a sType.

            </p>
            <p>Searchable Object or sObjects are the entries in the sType's table.  Each entry can be
                           thought of as a 'container' or 'placeholder' for the object it represents ( a shot, an
                           episode, a document etc). For example, Shot EP001_S003 is the sObject, which we can see
                           is an entry in the Shots table (sType) on the right.

                     <p>When you check in a file, it may involve one file or it might be 1000 files. A
                                            snapshot represents a complete package of that sObject at the point of check-in.
                                            Snapshots store the version and revision information, as well as the location of
                                            the file(s) in the file system. Snapshots can also store "dependencies" to other
                                            Snapshots. Dependencies provide a trail to indicate that one check-in is
                                            dependant on one or more other Snapshots.

                           objects are stored and categorized by a '<span class="bold"><strong>process</strong></span>'. For
                           example, the "design" process has notes, tasks, snapshots etc. All of these would be
                           stored within the shot EP001_S001.  Through this concept, all of the life-cycle
                           information regarding an object is easily accessible and organized and more importantly
                           are used to drive the object through it's pipeline.
