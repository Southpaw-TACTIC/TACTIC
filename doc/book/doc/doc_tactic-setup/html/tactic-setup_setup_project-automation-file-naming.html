            <p>The naming page provides a way of controlling directory and file naming conventions
               through a simple expression language . Each naming entry can contain a directory naming
               and/or file naming. It is designed that so that a relatively non-technical user can
                           create custom naming conventions for various sTypes.
            </p>
            <p>The relative path expression language is a simple language, but in order to understand
                           it you must know the basic components that generally make up a naming convention. The
                           expression language allows access to almost any data in TACTIC. The keywords which are
                           the most relevant in naming conventions are as follows:

            <p>The properties of these Search Objects are used to build up the naming

            </p>
            <p>A simple example of a relative path is as follows:</p><pre class="screen">{project.code}/sequence/{parent.code}/{sobject.code}/{snapshot.context}/maya</pre><p>which after translation could be translated into:</p><pre class="screen">sample3d/sequence/XG/XG001/model/maya</pre><p>This expression is explicit in that every variable scopes the object that the
                           attribute comes from. 
            </p>
            <p>Another example is for a file
                           name:
            </p><pre class="screen">{sobject.code}_{snapshot.context}_v{snapshot.version}.{ext}</pre><p>This can be translated into: <code class="code">chr001_model_v001.ma</code> upon expansion.
            </p>
            <p>The @GET(sobejct.code) or @GET(sobject.sthpw/snapshot.version) TACTIC expression
                           language syntax can be used instead; however, the original keyword approach is more
                           readable. In case you do decide to use the TEL syntax, here are the equivalents:
            </p>
            <p>{basefile} = {$BASEFILE}</p>
            <p>{ext} = {$EXT}</p>
            <p>{project.code} = {$PROJECT}</p>
            <p>{login} = {$LOGIN}</p>
            <p>It is important to note that you can't fix TEL syntax with the keyword syntax in the
                           same field of a naming entry.

            </h6>
            <p>Various assumptions have been made about which attributes are attached to which
                           SObjects. It is often the case that the context is composed of a number of parts that
                           are of interest to a naming convention.
            </p>
            <p>For example, it is conceivable to have a context named: "model/hi". However, you may
                           wish to break this up in a specific way in your naming convention. This is accomplished
                           using [] notation common to many programming languages.
            </p>
            <p>The following notation could be used for a directory using this: which could be
                           translated into 
            </p><pre class="screen"><span class="bold"><strong>Dir Naming:</strong></span> {code}/{context[0]}/maya/{context[1]}</pre><pre class="screen"><span class="bold"><strong>Result:</strong></span> chr001/model/maya/hi</pre></div>

                                  language syntax and the original keyword approach. It will also use expression
                                  language syntax to specify the condition.
