         <h5><a name="d0e7258"></a>Introduction
         </h5>
         <p>This document describes the construct of the <span class="bold"><strong>TEL</strong></span> TACTIC
            Expression Language. This language is a shorthand form to quickly retrieve information about
            related Search Objects. The expression either starts with a list of Search Objects and the
            operations of the expression language operate on these lists (this is quite similar to LISP
                    in concept) or it can be used as an absolute search.
         </p>
         <p>The expression language also borrows from spreadsheet syntax which is familiar to many
                    people. The reason behind using an expression language is that it is much simpler and
                    compact that using code or direct SQL. The TACTIC expression language is designed to be able
                    to easily retrieve data in a single command that would otherwise take many lines of
                    code.
         </p>
         <h5><a name="d0e7267"></a>Simple Example
         </h5>
         <p>The expression often starts with a list of Search Objects and then operates on these
                    Search Objects. 
         </p>
         <p>If you have a list of "prod/sequence" Search Objects, then the following: </p><pre class="screen">@GET(prod/shot.code)</pre><p>will return a list of codes of these prod/shot Search Objects related to the starting
                    "prod/sequence". The notation for the method GET is of the form
                    &lt;search_type&gt;.&lt;column&gt;. As will be shown below, multiple search_types can be strung
                    together to navigate across related search_types. The @GET function operate on a list and
                    returned a list.
         </p>
         <p>If no starting sObject is given, this expression will return a list of codes for every
                    shot in the project. In the python or javascript API, you can control whether there is a
                    starting sobject with the kwarg search_keys
         </p>
         <p>With the above example, here is how to get the shot codes for the given sequence with the
                    code "seq001":
         </p>
         <p><span class="bold"><strong>Python API</strong></span></p>
         <p>server = TacticServerStub.get()</p>
         <p>expr = "@GET(prod/shot.code)"</p>
         <p>result = server.eval(expr,
                    search_keys=['prod/sequence?project=vfx&amp;code=seq001'])
         </p>
         <p>By default, the result returned is a list unless you specify the kwarg single=True in
                    server.eval() 
         </p>
         <p>result = server.eval(expr, search_keys=['prod/sequence?project=vfx&amp;code=seq001'],
                    single=True)
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>In Javascript, via the Script Edtor, you can achieve the same result with these
                    scripts:
         </p>
         <p><span class="bold"><strong>Javascript API</strong></span></p>
         <p>var server =  TacticServerStub.get();</p>
         <p>var expr = "@GET(prod/shot.code)"</p>
         <p>var result = server.eval(expr, {search_keys:
                    ['prod/sequence?project=vfx&amp;code=seq001'], single: true});
         </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>In certain places, like in a Custom Layout Element, Expression Element in a Table, or
                    notification set-up, there is an assumed starting sObject, which is the one you are viewing
                    or the notification event refers to during an update or insert action.
         </p>
         <h5><a name="d0e7309"></a>Searching
         </h5>
         <p>The expression language can be used as a shorthand for search for Search Objects. This is
                    often convenient because the expression language is a pure string and can be stored a number
                    of formats, including XML. 
         </p>
         <p>The @SOBJECT method will retrieve entire Search Objects. </p>
         <p>Search for all assets </p><pre class="screen">@SOBJECT(prod/asset)</pre><p>Search only for characters by applying a filter </p><pre class="screen">@SOBJECT(prod/asset['asset_library','chr']</pre><p>You can also apply multiple filters. And operation is implied </p><pre class="screen">@SOBJECT(prod/asset['asset_library','chr']['timestamp','&gt;','2009-01-01'])</pre><p>You can also apply multiple filters. To use OR operation with more than 2 filters. For
                    example, with code containing the word prop1, OR asset_library is chr, OR timestamp after
                    2009-01-01. Note: EQ stands for case-sensitive match.
         </p><pre class="screen">@SOBJECT(prod/asset['begin']['asset_library','chr']['timestamp','&gt;','2009-01-01']['code','EQ','prop1']['or'])</pre><p>To use OR operation  with 2 filters followed by an AND operation. For example, with
                    asset_library is chr OR timestamp after 2009-01-01 AND  code containing the word prop1. If
                    there are only 2 filters, there is no need to sandwich it with begin. 
         </p><pre class="screen">@SOBJECT(prod/asset['begin']['asset_library','chr']['timestamp','&gt;','2009-01-01']['or']['code','EQ','prop1'])</pre><p>To </p><pre class="screen">@SOBJECT(prod/asset['begin']['asset_library','chr']['timestamp','&gt;','2009-01-01']['or']['code','EQ','prop1'])</pre><p>Note that full filter operations from the Client API are supported. </p>
         <h5><a name="d0e7341"></a>Navigating Search Types
         </h5>
         <p>One of the true powers of the expression language is the simplicity in which it can
                    navigate between various related Search Types using a navigational syntax. The expression
                    language makes use of the project schema to navigate dependencies between the search_types.
                    For example a sequence is related to a shot.
         </p>
         <p>The navigational syntax is used as arguments for many aggregate methods. When detected,
                    the expression language will perform a search through the hierarchy to retrieve the desired
                    search results.
         </p>
         <p>A simple example of the navigation syntax in the expression language is as follows: </p><pre class="screen">@GET(prod/sequence.code)</pre><p>This expression will get all of the codes of the sequences of related to each Search
                    Object. 
         </p>
         <p>The expression can also navigate multiple levels of search types to dig deeply into the
                    hierarchy. For example, this will get all of the descriptions of all of the episodes that
                    belong to the sequences of the original shots.
         </p><pre class="screen">@GET(prod/sequence.prod/episode.description)</pre><p> Another useful illustration is to get all of the tasks of all of the shots:</p><pre class="screen">@SOBJECT(prod/shot.sthpw/task)</pre><p> Get the last 50 tasks ordered by process of all of the shots:</p><pre class="screen">@SOBJECT(prod/shot.sthpw/task['@ORDER_BY','process']['@LIMIT','50'])</pre><h5><a name="d0e7365"></a>Aggregate functions
         </h5>
         <p>The expression language defines a number of aggregate functions which will operate on the
                    list. 
         </p>
         <p>This will give the addition of all the duration attributes of the provided shots. </p><pre class="screen">@SUM(prod/shot.duration)</pre><p>This will give the average duration attribute of all of the shots. </p><pre class="screen">@AVG(prod/shot.duration)</pre><p>This will give a count of all of the Search Objects </p><pre class="screen">@COUNT(prod/shot)</pre><p>All of these aggregates return a single value which can be used to operate on other lists. </p>
         <h5><a name="d0e7383"></a>Operations
         </h5>
         <p>The expression language operates on lists. The operator will operate on each element of
                    the list independently and return a list For example when doing a subtraction operation on
                    items:
         </p><pre class="screen">@GET(prod/shot.end_frame) - @GET(prod/shot.start_frame)</pre><p>The first @GET will return a list of start frames and the second @GET will return a list
                    end frames. When two lists are operated on the results are calculated based on items at the
                    same position in each list. So if we had two lists: 
         </p><pre class="screen">[300, 155, 100] - [100, 100, 100] = [200, 55, 0]</pre><p>Similarly, lists will be multiplied as follows</p><pre class="screen">[5, 4, 3] * [5, 4, 3] = [25, 16, 9]</pre><p>The expression language supports most operation support by the python language
                    itself.
         </p><pre class="screen">&gt;&gt;&gt; Search.eval("5 * 25")
125.0

&gt;&gt;&gt; Search.eval("5 + 25")
30.0

&gt;&gt;&gt; Search.eval("(25 - 5) * 5")
100.0

&gt;&gt;&gt; Search.eval("5 / 25") 0.20000000000000001

&gt;&gt;&gt; Search.eval("@COUNT(sthpw/task) * 5")
2310.0

&gt;&gt;&gt; Search.eval("@COUNT(sthpw/task) &gt; 0")
True

&gt;&gt;&gt; Search.eval("@COUNT(sthpw/task) == 462")
True

&gt;&gt;&gt; Search.eval("@COUNT(sthpw/task) != 462")
False </pre><p>The expression language also supports the regular expression syntax</p>
         <p>The following tests whether the name_first column starts with "John"</p><pre class="screen">@GET(.name_first) ~ '^John'</pre><h5><a name="d0e7407"></a>More complex operations
         </h5>
         <p>You can do more complex operations by combining the above. The following will return a
                    cost list of all of the shots (assigned user wage * number of hours worked).
         </p><pre class="screen">@GET(prod/shot.sthpw/task.sthpw/login.wage) * @GET(prod/shot.num_hours)
</pre><p> You could add them all together using @SUM this to get the total</p><pre class="screen">@SUM(
  @GET(prod/shot.sthpw/task.sthpw/login.wage) * @GET(prod/shot.num_hours)
)</pre><p>There are times the sObjects returned are not unique. The @UNIQUE operator can be used to
                    return a unique list of result. The following returns the unique list of login sObjects
                    related to the task list provided. The @COUNT operator computes the total number of login
                    sObjects.
         </p><pre class="screen">
 # my.tasks is a list of tasks        
 expression = "@COUNT(@UNIQUE(@SOBJECT(sthpw/login)))"
 result = my.parser.eval(expression, my.tasks)
    </pre><h5><a name="d0e7421"></a>Manipulating Strings 
         </h5>
         <p>Most of the operations in the expression language operate on lists and either return lists
                    or return single values. However, it is often required that expressions be used in string
                    concatenation. A simplified notation is to use curly brackets {} to represent an operation
                    that converts the result of an expression into a string. 
         </p>
         <p>For a file to be named chr001_model.png, we could use: </p><pre class="screen">{@GET(prod/asset.code)}_{@GET(sthpw/snapshot.context)}.png</pre><p>** The file naming conventions do not current use the expression language. The presently
                    use a simplified expression language. The plan is to merge the two at some point. 
         </p>
         <h5><a name="d0e7431"></a>String Formatting
         </h5>
         <p>For string values, the string operator them can use standard print formatting: </p><pre class="screen">v{@GET(sthpw/snapshot.version),%0.3d}
</pre><p>will return "v012", for example. </p>
         <p>The expression language also supports formatting through regular expressions </p><pre class="screen">{ @GET(prod/asset.description),|^(\w{5})| }
</pre><p>This will get the first 5 word characters for the description. Since the full expression
                    language is supported, it is possible to extract a wide variety of parts. Anything matched
                    with () will be returned as the value. 
         </p>
         <p>**If there are multiple groupings, the expression language will concatenate the values
                    together. 
         </p>
         <p>The following will return the first 3 and last 3 characters of the description. </p><pre class="screen">{ @GET(prod/asset.description),|^(\w{3}).*(\w{3})$| }
</pre><p>The following will return the last 5 characters of the description of the current SObject even if it is written in French
            or Chinese. 
         </p><pre class="screen">{ @GET(.description),|^(.{5})$| }
</pre><p><span class="bold"><strong>Time related formatting</strong></span></p>
         <p>The following formats a timestamp by extracting just the month and date (old way):</p><pre class="screen">{ @GET(.timestamp), %b-%m}
</pre><p>The following formats a timestamp by extracting just the year </p><pre class="screen">{ @GET(.timestamp), %Y}
     </pre><p>The following removes the hours, minutes and seconds from the built-in $TODAY variable so
                    only 2011-11-11 is displayed 
         </p><pre class="screen">{ $TODAY,|([^\s]+)| }
</pre><p>The following formats a timestamp by using the new @FORMAT function </p><pre class="screen">@FORMAT( @GET(.timestamp), '31/12/1999')
        </pre><pre class="screen">@FORMAT( @GET(.timestamp), 'Dec 31, 1999')
    </pre><p>The following formats it according to a project wide date-time setting or date-only
                    setting. You can define what DATETIME and DATE is in the Project Settings page.
         </p><pre class="screen">@FORMAT( @GET(.timestamp), 'DATETIME')
@FORMAT( @GET(.timestamp), 'DATE')
</pre><p>Either of the following formats a frame count into timecode </p><pre class="screen">@FORMAT( @GET(.frame_count), 'MM:SS.FF')
         </pre><p>The following formats a frame count into hours, minutes and seconds in 30fps, leaving out
                    the frames.
         </p><pre class="screen">@FORMAT( @GET(.frame_count), 'HH:MM:SS', '30')
        </pre><p>The following formats a cost column in currency format </p><pre class="screen">@FORMAT(@GET(.cost), '-$1,234.00')
        </pre><p>'31/12/99 13:37' can be used to show both date and time</p>
