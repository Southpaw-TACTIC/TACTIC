TACTIC’s core functionality. Virtually any TACTIC functionality can be
encapsulated in a plugin. A TACTIC plugin is composed of a number of
possible elements:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
manifest.xml: a file describing the contents in the database that
belong to the plugin and also some metadata about the plugin
</li><li class="listitem">
media files (images)
</li><li class="listitem">
html, javascript, css files
</li></ul></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Plugins Community Site</strong></span></p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="media/1_community_plugins_site.png" alt="image" /></span></p><p>The Community Site is a central resource to search for plugins. You can
find existing plugins to download and use from the plugins section. You
can download the .zip file from the information section found to the
right of each plugin page. You can also find older versions or previous
releases from the downloads tab of each plugin page.</p><p>There are many other things you can do at the plugins community site.
Before you download a plugin, you can go and check the ratings of the
plugin to find out how other users have liked it. You can find
documentation to get information about the plugin or help in installing
the plugin. After you’ve used the plugin, you can also go rate the
plugin. It might also be helpful if you write a review for the plugin.
This can give other users feedback to know how useful the plugin is.</p><p>Plugins don’t have to be manually downloaded by you to install them.
TACTIC has built-in functionality that automatically downloads and
installs plugins if you have provided the url to the plugin .zip file.
For more info on this and how to install the plugin using this method,
look at the next "Install and Activate" section.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_install_and_activate"></a>8.2. Install and Activate</h3></div></div></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Install and Activate</strong></span></p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="media/0_plugins_overview.png" alt="image" /></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Plugin Manager</strong></span></p><p>The Plugin Manager is the primary tool for loading, unloading, deleting
and creating plugins.</p><p>To open the Plugin Manager, go to:</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>sidebar → Admin views → Project → Plugins</strong></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>How to Install a Plugin</strong></span></p><p>Plugins are installed through the Plugin Manager. When a plugin is
installed, the plugin’s .zip file is placed in the
&lt;TACTIC_DATA_DIR&gt;/dist and the contents are extracted to the
&lt;TACTIC_DATA_DIR&gt;/plugin directory.</p><p>There are two ways to install a plugin, one way is through the URL. This
involves copying the link address of the .zip file from the plugin page.
You can then paste the URL back in tactic and press <span class="strong"><strong>Install</strong></span>.</p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="media/1_copy_link_address.png" alt="image" /></span></p><p>The other way to install a plugin is to browse for the .zip file. Once
the Plugin Manager is open, do the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">
click on the green plus "+" button to open the panel
</li><li class="listitem">
click on the <span class="strong"><strong>Browse</strong></span> and select the .zip file you have downloaded.
</li></ul></div><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="media/1_install_browse.png" alt="image" /></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>How to Activate a Plugin</strong></span></p><p>Plugins are activated through the Plugin Manager.</p><p>Once the plugin is installed (see section above on installing a plugin)
the plugin will appear in the Plugin List.</p><p>In order to use a plugin in a particular project, it must be activated.
"Activation" of a plugin will register the plugin and import any
configuration as specified in the .spt file. Since each project has its
own set of independent plugins, it is possible that different plugins
versions are active on different projects. However, only one version of
a plugin may be active at a time on any given project. This allows you
to have several different plugins installed in Tactic but you select
which ones you want to have active in the project you are working on.</p><p>To activate a plugin, in the Plugin Manager, select the plugin from the
Plugin List. The panel on the right will open.</p><p>In the new panel, select <span class="strong"><strong>Info</strong></span> from the list of tabs and click on the
<span class="strong"><strong>Activate</strong></span> button.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Multiple versions of the same plugin</strong></span></p><p>A TACTIC installation can have multiple different versions of the same
plugin installed, but only one version of the plugin can be active on a
single project. For the most part, different projects can have different
plugins active without interference. Because of the flexibility of
TACTIC and TACTIC’s plugins, it is entirely possible to break this, so
care must be taken to write self-contained plugins that will not
interfere with others.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Updating a plugin</strong></span></p><p>Plugins can be updated simply by deactivating an older version and
activating a new version of the plugin. Most plugins should have no
trouble with this, however, it is possible that any given plugin
requires special instructions. Refer to the documentation of the
individual plugin for more details if any exist.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_remove_and_delete"></a>8.3. Remove and Delete</h3></div></div></div><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="media/1_removing_a_plugin.png" alt="image" /></span></p><p>There is a difference between removing a plugin and deleting a plugin.
Once you have a plugin in your TACTIC directory, that means you have
installed the plugin and it means that you can see it in the plugin list
of the plugin manager view. If you have a plugin activated, it means the
plugin is being used in the current project you have open. To remove a
plugin means to deactivate the plugin from the current project. You can
only remove a plugin if it is activated. You can remove a plugin by
pressing the "Remove" button as it is shown in the screenshot above.
Removing a plugin does not remove the plugin from TACTIC.</p><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="media/2_deleting_a_plugin.png" alt="image" /></span></p><p>On the other hand, deleting a plugin deletes it from TACTIC and so it is
gone from every single project it was being used in. Deleting a plugin
is risky because another project using the plugin might not work without
it. It is safe practice to delete a plugin after making sure no other
project uses it. You can delete a plugin by first going to the plugin
manager. You can then right click on the plugin you want to delete from
the plugin list and select "Delete Plugin". You can see this in the
screenshot above.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr /><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ar01s07.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="ar01s09.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top"> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table></div></body></html>
