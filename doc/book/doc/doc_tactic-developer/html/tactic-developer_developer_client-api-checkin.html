            <p>Any sObject can become a "container" for check-ins. This has the advantage that you can

                           provided by TACTIC. The rest of this section describes the different types of check-ins

            <p>The group_checkin() function allows you to check in a sequence of files, defined by a
                           frame range:
            </p><pre class="screen">&lt;start&gt;-&lt;end&gt;/&lt;by&gt;</pre><p>For example, a frame range of 1 to 10 is descibed as "1-10". Or every second frame
                           from frame 20 to frame 50 can be described as "20-50/2".
            </p>
            <p>TACTIC provides two notations to describe the file names of a range of frames. This
                           special notation, in conjunction with the frame range, can generate a sequence of files.
                           The two notations are as follows:

    context = "test_checkin"
    snapshot = server.group_checkin(search_key, context, file_pattern, file_range)
    print snapshot.get('snapshot')</pre><p>When executed, this example will check in a sequence of 24 files starting from 1 to
                           24. It should be noted that this method will by default expect that the files have been
                           uploaded to the server. For this reason, it is often recommended to use preallocated
                           check-ins for both sequence and directory check-ins.
            </p>

            <p>As the name suggests, a directory check-in enables an entire directory and all of its
                           subdirectories to be checked in. TACTIC does not keep track of the contents of the
                           checked-in directory. This allows you to check in complex directory structures without
                           having to inform TACTIC of all of the details of the contents. This might be the best
                           approach when all the details of the directory are already handled by some other system
                           so it is not necessary for TACTIC to track things.
            </p>
            <p>Here is a code example of checking in a
                           directory:
            </p><pre class="screen">    file_path = "./test/XG002/beauty"

    # build the search key
    search_type = "unittest/person"
    code = "joe" 
    search_key = my.server.build_search_key(search_type, code)
    context = "test_checkin"

    # simple check-in of a file.
    desc = 'A Simple Checkin'
    snapshot = my.server.directory_checkin(search_key, context, file_path, description=desc)
    print snapshot.get('snapshot')</pre><p>Note that this code is very similar to single file check-ins ( simple_checkin() ),
                           because TACTIC treats a directory check-in in a similar manner to a file check-in. It uses
                           the leaf directory as the file name. It is important to consider naming conventions,
                           because this leaf directory will be handled using file naming conventions even though it
                           is a directory.
            </p>
            <p>As with group_checkin(), this method already expects the files to have been uploaded
                           to the server in the appropriate place. There are various modes that can be used to
                           alter the manner in which the files get to the server repository. For details, see the
                           "modes" section below.

            <p>TACTIC allows you to build up a check-in piecewise or stages. This is a powerful
                           feature because you can build a check-in over the course of many operations (and many
                           transactions if desired) and the whole set of operations will be treated as a single
                           versioned entity. The TACTIC snapshot definition allows for the entry of multiple files
                           into a single check-in. Typically, the process begins by creating a new "empty" snapshot.
                           This snapshot is a placeholder which reserves a version and context for a particular set
                           of future operations. Once this empty snapshot is created, you can start adding files
                           and dependencies to it. 
            </p>
            <p>The following example checks in a Maya file and a corresponding OBJ
                           file.
            </p><pre class="screen">    maya_path = "./test/chr001/chr001_model.ma"
    obj_path = "./test/chr001/chr001_mode.obj"

    # build the search key
    search_type = "unittest/person"
    code = "joe" 
    context = "test_checkin"
    search_key = my.server.build_search_key(search_type, code)

    # create an empty snapshot
    desc = 'A Piecewise Checkin'
    snapshot = my.server.create_snapshot(search_key, context, description=desc)
    print "empty"
    print snapshot.get('snapshot')

    snapshot_code = snapshot.get('code')
    snapshot = my.server.add_file(snapshot_code, maya_path, file_type='maya')
    snapshot = my.server.add_file(snapshot_code, obj_path, file_type='obj')
    print
    print "two files"
    print snapshot.get('snapshot')</pre><p>Executing this code will result in the
                           following:
            </p><pre class="screen">empty
&lt;snapshot/&gt;

two files
&lt;snapshot&gt;
  &lt;file name='chr001_model_v001.ma' file_code='1044BAR' type='maya'/&gt;
  &lt;file name='chr001_model_v001.obj' file_code='1045BAR' type='obj'/&gt;
&lt;/snapshot&gt;</pre><p>First, an empty snapshot is created using create_snapshot(), then files are added to
                           this snapshot one by one. Note that the type here is explicitly specified. This type
                           differentiates one file in a snapshot from another.
            </p>
            <p>It is also possible to add a sequence of files or even a directory to a snapshot:</p><pre class="screen">    pattern = "./test/miso_ramen.%0.4d.tif"
    file_range = '1-24'
    snapshot = server.add_group(snapshot_code, file_pattern, file_range, file_type='sequence')
    print snapshot.get('snapshot')

    directory = "./test/test_directory"
    snapshot = server.add_directory(snapshot_code, directory, file_type='directory')
    print snapshot.get('code')</pre><p>Executing the last code snippet will give the following
                           results:

            <p>There are various modes that you can use to check in files. These modes determine how
                           a file will be transferred to the repository. 
            </p>
            <div class="itemizedlist">
               <ul class="itemizedlist">
                  <li class="listitem">
                     <p>upload: Uploads the files to a temporary directory</p>
                  </li>
                  <li class="listitem">
                     <p>copy: Copies the files to the handoff directory</p>
                  </li>
                  <li class="listitem">
                     <p>move: Moves the files to the handoff directory.</p>
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </div>
            <p>The previous simple_checkin() example uses the "upload" mode. This means that the
                           client will connect to the server and use an HTTP connection to upload the file to the
                           server where it will be subsequently checked in. HTTP does not require any additional
                           setup and it may be the only choice available for facilities having only WAN access to
                           the TACTIC server. However, HTTP is a very slow transport protocol so, if possible, it
                           is better and faster to use other available modes.
            </p>
            <p>The copy and move modes use a "handoff" directory, which is an intermediate directory
                           that is visible on the network to both the client machine and the TACTIC server. When
                           the check-in is executed, the files are first copied or moved to this handoff directory.
                           The TACTIC server is then notified and grabs the files and puts them into the
                           repository, renaming as the naming conventions stipulate. The files are always "moved"
                           from the handoff directory to the repository. The advantage of using these modes over
                           the "upload" mode is that they go through NFS or CIFS. These modes make use of the
                           fast networks and huge file servers that are available in typical media and production
                           facilities.
            </p>
            <p>The copy and modes require a bit of setup because the server and the client must be
                           able to see the handoff directory. You need to configure the TACTIC server configuration

            <p>After you set the configuration, you can then use the copy or move modes to take
                           advantage of the handoff directory:
            </p><pre class="screen">    # simple check-in of a file using move mode
    desc = 'A Simple Checkin'
    snapshot = my.server.simple_checkin(search_key, context, file_path, description=desc, mode="move")
    print snapshot.get('snapshot')</pre><p>Note that the only difference in this example from earlier check-in examples is that
                           the mode parameter is set to "move".

            <p>Preallocated check-ins are the most efficient check-ins. Bandwidth and storage space are
                           expensive commodities in a typical media or production facility, so there is a definite
                           cost and time benefit to reducing their use as much as possible.
            </p>
            <p>Preallocated check-ins enable a client process to be checked directly into the
                           repository. They are recommended for check-ins that are very heavy in either bandwidth or
                           disk usage and are designed to minimize both. Some production processes that would
                           benefit from using this check-in mode include rendering frames, ingesting plates,
                           simulating data, and so on.
            </p>
            <p>The following steps describe the process for preallocating check-ins:</p>
            <div class="orderedlist">
               <ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
                  <li class="listitem">
                     <p>Create an empty snapshot to reserve a check-in version and context. </p>
                  </li>
                  <li class="listitem">
                     <p>Ask for a path in the repository from the TACTIC server.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li class="listitem">
                     <p>Create the files directly in the path given by the TACTIC server.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li class="listitem">
                     <p>Inform TACTIC that the files have been placed in the appropriate
                                            location.
                     </p>
                  </li>
               </ol>
            </div>
            <p>The path supplied by TACTIC in the preallocation is located directly in the
                           repository. The process generating the files can thus save the files directly to the
                           correct location in the repository (following all the predefined naming conventions).
                           Files are created directly in the repository with the correct directory and file name as
                           TACTIC would have checked them in using the other methods. This eliminates later having
                           to copy or move files around the network unnecessarily, as is typically required by
                           other check-in modes.
            </p>
            <p>Because the simple_checkin(), group_checkin() and directory_checkin() functions
                           perform the entire check-in process in one step, you cannot use them for preallocated
                           check-ins. Instead, you would use a piecewise check-in to build up the checked in parts.
                           The following is an example of a preallocated check-in using a piecewise
                           approach:
            </p><pre class="screen">    search_type = "prod/render"
    code = "XG002_beauty" 
    search_key = my.server.build_search_key(search_type, code)

    # create an empty snapshot
    desc = 'A Preallocated Checkin'
    context = "render"
    snapshot = my.server.create_snapshot(search_key, context, description=desc)

    # get the preallocated path
    snapshot_code = snapshot.get('code')
    file_pattern = snapshot.get_preallocated_path(snapshot_code, file_type="main")
    print "file_pattern: ", file_path

    # generate the files
    for i in range(1, 20):
        file_path = file_pattern % i
        render_file(file_path)

    # add the files to the snapshot
    snapshot = server.add_group(snapshot_code, file_type="main", file_range="1-20", mode="preallocate")
    print snapshot.get("snapshot")</pre><p>Executing the above code would result in output something
                           like:
            </p><pre class="screen">file_pattern: XG002_beauty_v012.%0.4d.tif
&lt;snapshot&gt;
  &lt;file name="XG002_beauty_v012.%0.4d.tif" file_code="123BAR" type="main"/&gt;
&lt;/snapshot&gt;</pre><p>The file pattern returned is completely dependent on naming conventions. In this case,
                           the search_type would have had to define a naming convention whereby the context of
                           "render" produces the above file pattern. For example, the file naming convention code
                           could
                           include:
            </p><pre class="screen">def prod_render(my):
    render = my.sobject
    ext = my.get_file_ext()

    parts = []
    parts.append( render.get_value('code') )
    parts.append( "v%0.3d" % my.snapshot.get_value("version")  )

    file_name = "_".join(parts) + ".%0.4d" + ext
    return file_name</pre><p>(See the naming convention documentation for more information on how to set up naming
                           conventions.)
            </p>
            <p>It should be noted that the function get_preallocated_path() returns a full path,
                           including the filename as specified by the naming conventions. Ideally, TACTIC must be
                           able to generate the correct path that can be used to save the files (as in the example
                           above).
            </p>
            <p>There is enormous advantage to using preallocated check-ins. Files are created directly
                           to the repository, eliminating all of the unnecessary copying of files around the
                           servers. When groups of files reach the muti-gigabyte or even terabyte range, it becomes
                           prohibitively expensive to check in files in the traditional manner. Preallocated
                           check-ins maximize the use of your internal system architecture.

            <p>In general, the in-place check-in should be considered as the last resort. In-place
                           check-ins do not make use of the TACTIC naming conventions, and may be the only option
                           when you are confronted by a legacy directory structure. Using this check-in method makes
                           the assumption that you will be able to later define logic that will map to a desired
                           naming convention. As a guideline, naming conventions should be procedural and as simple
                           as possible, so you must plan carefully before considering in-place check-ins.
