            <p>The easiest way to interact with the server from the client using the Client API is to
                           use the provided server stub code. This code includes a class and a utility that are
                           very useful for handling many of the details around client/server interaction and
                           authentication.
            </p>
            <p>The server stub code is housed in a client folder and can be found in the TACTIC
                           installation in the directory:
            </p><pre class="screen">&lt;tactic_install_dir&gt;/src/client</pre><p>The first step is to copy the entire client folder over to the client machine (the
                           machine that will be running the scripts) to a directory that will be visible to the
                           user. Most facilities would likely put this folder in a centralized location so that
                           every computer would be able to execute its scripts. The path to this folder must be
                           specified in the PYTHONPATH environment variable on client machines so that it can be
                           found by the scripts. For instance, if PYTHONPATH = L:/custom_python. you would put the
                           client folder in  L:/custom_python. Please refer to the Python documentation for more
                           information.

            <p>There are three important parameters for setting up the TacticServerStub to connect
                           correctly :
            </p>
            <div class="itemizedlist">
               <ul class="itemizedlist">
                  <li class="listitem">
                     <p>server: specifies the server that the server stub will connect to. This
                                                server can be a domain name ("localhost") or an IP address ("127.0.0.1"). It
                                                can even be a port number ("localhost:9000"). This setting allows you to
                                                switch between various TACTIC servers in your facility.
                     </p>
                  </li>
                  <li class="listitem">
                     <p>project: specifies the current project. In TACTIC, the project is a state
                                                under which interactions occur.
                     </p>
                  </li>
                  <li class="listitem">
                     <p>ticket: specifies the authentication ticket, a long alpha-numeric string
                                                that encrypts the login and password so that these values remain
                                                secure.
                     </p>
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </div>
            <p>There are a number of methods to set these parameters.</p>
            <p>The <span class="bold"><strong>first method</strong></span> is to set the following parameters
                           directly in the server stub
                           reference:
            </p><pre class="screen">server = TacticServerStub()
server.set_server(tactic_server)
server.set_project(project)
# this is not needed if you have run python get_ticket.py
server.set_ticket(ticket)</pre><p>These settings override all settings obtained elsewhere. This method ensures that
                           these values are set up correctly based on some external information.
            </p>
            <p>To set up a server stub, you can insert the stub information in your script (described
                           in the client API documentation as part of the get_ticket() function). Or, you can run
                           the script <span class="bold"><strong>get_ticket.py</strong></span>, which is included with the
                           client API example set (located in &lt;TACTIC_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/src/client/bin). When the
                           stub is run, it creates a ticket file on the user's machine which will be used each time
                           any API script is run to authenticate which user is running the script.
            </p>
            <p>The <span class="bold"><strong>second method</strong></span> is through environment variables
                           set up across the studio:
            </p>
            <div class="itemizedlist">
               <ul class="itemizedlist">
                  <li class="listitem">
                     <p>TACTIC_SERVER: sets the server that the server stub will connect
                                                to.
                     </p>
                  </li>
                  <li class="listitem">
                     <p>TACTIC_PROJECT: sets the project that the server stub will connect
                                                to.
                     </p>
                  </li>
                  <li class="listitem">
                     <p>TACTIC_TICKET: sets the authentication ticket.</p>
                  </li>
               </ul>
            </div>
            <p>This method can be used by programs that set up user environments, and has other
                           advantages. It is easy to switch the settings using a shell variable. The program that
                           sets up the environment does not have to be written in Python. It can even be simple to
                           set up by using a shell command line to set the environment variables.
            </p>
            <p>The <span class="bold"><strong>third method</strong></span> makes use of a resource file located
                           in the user's home directory. This resource file has a simple
                           format:
            </p><pre class="screen">login=joe
server=localhost
ticket=97d2bec3d73da71c14fb724a47af5053
project=bar</pre><p>The login tag doesn't actually do anything here, since the user name is encapsulated
                           in the ticket itself.
            </p>
            <p>The <span class="bold"><strong>fourth method</strong></span> is described below:
            </p>

               </div>
            </div>
            <p>If you have written a GUI or have some means of retrieving the user's password on
                           individual session instead, you can use the following construct to set the ticket. The
                           server's IP and project should be set beforehand.
            </p><pre class="screen">  
     server = TacticServerStub.get()
     server_IP = '10.10.50.100'
     my.set_server(server_IP)
     my.set_project('sample3d')

     ticket = my.get_ticket(login, password)
     my.set_ticket(ticket)
    </pre><p>Once you have set up the environment for the client API to run correctly, you can try
                           a sample script. The following simple script illustrates the structure of a TACTIC
                           Client API
                           program:
            </p><pre class="screen">import sys
from tactic_client_lib import TacticServerStub

def main(args):
    server = TacticServerStub()
    server.start("Ping Test")
    try:
        print server.ping()
    except:
        server.abort()
        raise
    else:
        server.finish()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    executable = sys.argv[0]
    args = sys.argv[1:]
    main(args)
</pre><p>This simple program will ping the server and return "OK". If everything is set up
                           correctly, you should be able to run this program from a shell as
                           follows:
            </p><pre class="screen"># python ping.py
OK</pre><p>If you see "OK", then you have successfully connected to the TACTIC server using the
                           client API.
            </p>
            <p>If you need to run python get_ticket.py first, it can be found under:
