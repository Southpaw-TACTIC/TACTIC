         <p>The TACTIC architecture is an MVC architecture with the following major components:</p>
         <div class="informaltable">

               <colgroup>

                     <td>Provides the data model. All interactions with the data model use
                                                sObjects and their derived classes.
                     </td>

                     <td>Provides the display model, which determines the user interface and how
                                                users interact with the web application. The display architecture is built
                                                upon hierarchical widgets that are SObject-aware (that is, they use sObjects
                                                to define the interface).
                     </td>

                                                affecting the data model or the filesystem must go through a command layer
                                                so that the changes can be tracked and completely undoable should something
                                                go wrong.
                     </td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                     <td><span class="bold"><strong>Search </strong></span></td>
                     <td>Provides a search model so widgets can obtain the SObjects they need to
                                                complete the interface display. Each type of sObject has a registered name
                                                which is used in the search engine to identify which sType to search. This
                                                provides a consistent interface to access all sObjects regardless of the
                                                location of the sObject in the database or table.

            </table>
         </div>
         <p>In summary, widgets make use of the Search, get SObjects, and use commands to change
                    persistent data. The sObject communication unit binds the view layer with the data
                    model.
         </p>
         <div class="simplesect" title="Main Data Objects">
            <div class="titlepage">
               <div>
                  <div>
                     <h4 class="title"><a name="d0e73"></a>Main Data Objects

            </div>
            <p>SObjects (searchable objects) are atomic, self-contained units that contain
                           attributes. A particular sObject can be uniquely identified by two parameters: a search
                           type and a search ID. Often these two parameters are combined into a "search key"
                           defined as &lt;search_type&gt;|&lt;search_id&gt; (joined with the "|" character). Search keys
                           allow you to uniquely identify any SObject using a single string.
            </p>
            <p>Particular SObjects are obtained using the search engine, which generally returns a
                           list of SObjects. The search engine is flexible enough to allow arbitrary bits of SQL
                           code to be used for a search, although that approach is discouraged. (To maximize code
                           reuse, it is better to put SQL code inside the low-level business objects that provide
                           static functions to higher level parts of the framework.)
            </p>
            <p>Widgets are the atomic drawing units. Typically, widgets are SObject-aware and can
                           perform and affect searches and draw SObjects. Widgets can contain children, and many
                           function calls will traverse down to their children. For example, a widget can be
                           assigned a search object. It will perform this search and pass the results to all of its
                           children widgets, who will make use of the result as necessary.
            </p>
            <p>One important widget function is the get_display() function, which draws widgets and
                           can generate HTML. This function can be as simple as just drawing something that has
                           nothing to do with sObject data, or can be a complicated function retrieving and
                           displaying sObjects and all of their child sObjects. 
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>Widgets determine how users interact with the web application. They have a number of
                           useful properties that allow for the rapid development of web applications. For example,
                           they can have a search assigned to them to locate and retrieve sObjects. They can
                           typically perform actions across the search results, affecting multiple SObjects. 
            </p>
            <p>Widgets call events and listen to events, allowing for inter-widget communication.
                           They interact with each other in the web application by registering events. For example,
                           one widget, on initialization, may register itself as a listener for a named event.
                           Another widget may call the named event upon an arbitrary action, at which point all
                           widgets that are registered listeners for that event will be executed. This type of
                           interaction allows for multiple actions to occur as a result of a user interaction, such
                           as the click of a single button.
            </p>
            <p>Checkin/checkout is the framework for filesystem interaction. All interaction within
                           the checkin/checkout framework is done through the SObjects themselves so that they can
                           determine their own checkin/checkout conditions and mechanisms. The checkin framework
                           creates a 'snapshot' SObject that is related to the original SObject through a
                           search_id. It assigns a unique file ID for every transaction, and creates snapshot
                           attributes for the SObjects.
            </p>
            <p>Engineering requirements for a particular application must be gathered and translated
                           into widgets, including definitions of the widgets' relationships to each other.
            </p>
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>AJAX Widgets</strong></span></p>
            <p>TACTIC's widget hierarchy falls naturally within the AJAX paradigm, where widgets are
                           capable of redrawing themselves. Instead of refreshing the entire page, AJAX widgets
                           actively gather the required information from the page and send only that information to
                           the web server (as opposed to the entire contents of the page). The widget then
                           processes the information and updates itself. This technique makes a much more
                           interactive application because the web server only has to draw the individual widget
                           element instead of the entire page. In addition to a faster and more interactive
                           experience, AJAX widgets significantly reduce the overall load on the web server, making
                           TACTIC far more scalable with the same resources.
            </p>
            <p>TACTIC's interface runs on top the the client API, therefore all interaction between
                           the client and the server run on an XMLRPC layer resting on top of AJAX.  This is very
                           convenient for complex interactions between the client and the server.
            </p>
            <p><span class="bold"><strong>Web Drawing Engine</strong></span></p>
            <p>This drawing engine is based on numerous interface platforms generally geared towards
                           traditional application design. However, it has be adjusted to accommodate the unique
                           web environment. A typical application would define a number of predefined widgets and
                           assemble them in a hierarchical relationship.
            </p>
            <p>Specialized widgets must be created to serve specific functions: for example,
                           checkin/checkout widgets, download widgets, upload widgets, and navigation
                       widgets.
            </p>

               </div>
            </div>
            <p>All metadata is stored in an industry-standard SQL database. The database tables and
                           rows are clearly marked and readable, so it is easy to access the data directly. In
                           today's fast-changing environment, it is essential to be able to quickly read and
                           understand the underlying data stored to be able to maintain proper support for
                           diagnosing and fixing problems. 
            </p>
            <p>All data is accessed through sObject entities, which provide the object relational
                           mappings to the database tables. In general, a single sObject is represented by a row in
                           the table of a database. The table defines the type of SObjects stored in it, and there
                           is usually a one-to-one relationship between the attributes of each sObject and the
                           columns in the database.

                  <div>
                     <h4 class="title"><a name="d0e116"></a>Directory and File Naming Conventions

               </div>
            </div>
            <p>It is just as critical to be able to navigate the filesystem and understand what is
                           located there. Therefore, advanced naming conventions are filtered through naming
                           classes, which use clear procedures to create filenames based on metadata in the
                           database. On the other hand, naming conventions can be driven by some expressions such
                           as {sobject.code}_{snapshot.context}_v{snapshot.version}.{ext}.
            </p>
            <p>Directories and file naming are handled slightly differently. TACTIC builds file names
                           procedurally and then stores them in the database. On the other hand, TACTIC never
                           stores directory names directly in the database, but always builds them up procedurally.
                           This additional level of abstraction provides the opportunity to reorganize your asset
                           structure as needed (because the directory structure isn't hard-coded). Note that there
                           may be other dependencies that are outside the control of TACTIC, so great care must be
                           taken should you decide to reorganize the directory structure of your assets.
