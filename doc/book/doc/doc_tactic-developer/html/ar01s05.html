From this view, you can create a plugin, fully install a plugin, and
modify existing plugins. You can find all your installed plugins in the
plugin list at the left hand side of the view. This shows all the
plugins you have installed along with all the built-in plugins which
have come with your TACTIC installation. After selecting a plugin, you
have access to:</p><p>Plugin Info:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

of to extend the base functionality. Virtually any functionality in
TACTIC can be made into a plugin.</p><p>A plugin can contain:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

</li><li class="listitem">

</li></ul></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>manifest.xml file</strong></span></p><p>The manifest file is a description of the entries in the database that
are owned by the plugin. This allows the plugin manager to extract the
appropriate database entries and commit the .spt files. It contains
elements like:</p><p>data: a collection of name/value pairs that describe information about
the plugin</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

attributes:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

</li></ul></div></li></ul></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>.spt files</strong></span></p><p>".spt" files are database files that contain database schema structure and
database data. These files enable TACTIC to read and write database data
that is both platform and database independent. This abstractions allows
TACTIC plugins to be used on any supported TACTIC platform. An important
design criteria of .spt files are that they are human readable even when
the database entry contains xml or software code. More importantly, they
can be easily diff’ed using standard software tools so that the code
produced can show proper diffs using any source code management system
(such as Perforce, SVN or Git). This is essential for collaborative work
building plugins to delivery to a 3rd party.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Creating the Plugin</strong></span></p><p>Once you are in the plugin manager, you can the New button which creates
a new plugin outline. Afterwards, you can start filling in the details
like name, type, etc. On creation, a plugin type can be specified.
Depending on the plugin type a number of bootstrap data will be created
to support the structure of the plugin. After selecting Create, the
plugin will be created and you will be able to see it in the plugin
list.</p><p>If you go to the documentation tab, you will find that you are able to
create new documentation if the documentation doesn’t exist. This will
create a new file, doc.html, which you can edit now.</p><p>To add files to the plugin, select the plugin and go to the files tab.
Here, you will find many options like the ability to upload or simply
create a new file. The new files that you are uploading or creating are
used properly when their purpose is explained in the manifest.xml file.</p><p>After customizing the plugin to your needs, you can now package the
plugin to perhaps upload to the community site so others can use it.
Documentation on packaging can be found in this section under Packaging
a Plugin.</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Best Practices</strong></span></p><p>Widget config tables should not include code or id columns or they must
be explicitly set to values that are guaranteed to be unique on any
installation of TACTIC. Otherwise, the plugin should not depend on the
value of the code or id column.</p><p>This is also true of “custom_scripts” written in the script editor.</p><p>When referring to an sobject, always search by code (not id). When doing
this, make sure the code contains a namespace that will not conflict
with any other plugin.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_packaging_a_plugin"></a>5.3. Packaging a Plugin</h3></div></div></div><p><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="media/1_manifest_tab.png" alt="image" /></span></p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Plugin Directory</strong></span></p><p>A TACTIC plugin package is simply a .zip file containing all the files
of a plugin. Plugins are installed in the following directory:</p><p>&lt;TACTIC_DATA_DIR&gt;/plugins</p><p>The .zip files are usually stored in:</p><p>&lt;TACTIC_DATA_DIR&gt;/dist</p><p><span class="strong"><strong>Categories of Plugins</strong></span></p><p>Plugins are defined into categories. Due to the flexibility of the
plugin architecture, a single plugin can package tools, columns, and
themes in any combination. These categories are only used to organize
plugins and can also bootstrap common functionality that would be
packaged into a plugin.</p><p>All of these will have most of the view definitions in the Custom Layout
Editor. Each individual view can have a type. See Custom Layout Editor
documentation for more information on this.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem">

</li></ul></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Publishing the Plugin</strong></span></p><p>To package your created plugin to the tactic data directory, select the
plugin and go to the manifest tab. Here, you can make sure that the
plugin is named and versioned appropriately. You now need to make sure
that the manifest you’ve wrote is exported, exporting saves the manifest
data you have there to the manifest.xml file.You can now select Publish
and TACTIC will package all the files and create a .zip file of the
plugin folder from the root plugin folder (ie: &lt;TACTIC_DATA_DIR&gt;/plugins
). When a version is published, the folder of the current plugin is
taken and copied to a new folder with the name &lt;PLUGIN_CODE&gt;-&lt;VERSION&gt;.
Note that the PLUGIN_CODE can have “/” to present folders.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_plugin_versions"></a>5.4. Plugin Versions</h3></div></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="_tactic_packaging_python_scripts_into_a_plugin"></a>5.5. TACTIC - Packaging Python Scripts into a Plugin</h3></div></div></div><p><span class="strong"><strong>Creating Plugin for Scripts</strong></span></p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
Prepare a folder or folder structure containing all of the python scripts you would like to include in the plugin.

Copy your folder of scripts.
</li><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
On the server, go to the TACTIC installation location and locate the tactic_data/plugins folder. For example,  /home/tactic/tactic_data/plugins. In this "plugins" folder, paste the folder of your scripts here.
</p><p class="simpara">This specific "plugins" folder is tied directly into the TACTIC UI. By pasting your folder of scripts here, a series of plugins are created for each of the lowest level folders. Each of these lowest level folders could contain many different scripts. Essentially, only one folder could contain all the scripts and this would be the plugin. The entire folder structure with subfolders and final low level folders (plugins) will show up in the TACTIC "Plugin Manager" in the Administrative layer of TACTIC.</p><p class="simpara">For example, if there is a top level folder called "example_scripts" with a lower level folder called "python_scripts" that contained all of the scripts. If this entire "example_scripts" folder was pasted into the /home/tactic/tactic_data/plugins location on the server, the "Plugin Manager" in TACTIC will show that "example_scripts" is a drop down folder and underneath there is a plugin called "python_scripts" available in TACTIC for activation. This "python_scripts" plugin would contain all of your scripts.</p></li><li class="listitem">
Go to the Administrative layer in TACTIC and from the "Admin Link Startup" page, select "Plugin Manager".
</li><li class="listitem">
In the Plugin Manager, on the left side, there should be a list of files. Go to the folder that has all of your scripts and locate your plugin or plugins. The plugins are determined based on the description provided in Step 3.
</li><li class="listitem">
Click on one plugin and in the "Info" tab in the view that appears, click on the "Activate" button to activate the plugin. Wait until there is a notification in the view indicating that the plugin activated successfully. Activate each of the other plugins you have one at a time.

Once all plugins are activated, refresh the browser. It will ensure proper activation.
</li><li class="listitem">
With the plugins installed, all of the classes contained within the scripts that were loaded with the plugin are accessible from the Script Editor in TACTIC. All you would need to do is know where the classes are located within the files. For example:
